 INDICATION: 73 y/o woman s/p cardiac arrest. Assess lines and tubes placement
 as well as for CHF.

 A single portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. There are no prior
 studies available for comparison.

 The ETT is identified approximately 1-2 cm above the carina. There is an NG
 tube with its tip in the fundus of the stomach. An intra-aortic balloon pump
 is seen with its tip approximately 2 cm below the aortic arch.

 The overall heart size is enlarged with left ventricular predominance. The
 aorta appears calcified and unfolded. There is a diffuse combined interstitial
 and alveolar pattern of opacity consistent with pulmonary edema, presumably
 cardiogenic in origin. There is a probable small left pleural effusion. No
 areas of consolidation are identified.

 IMPRESSION: Positioning of lines and tubes as described above. The IABP is
 appropriately positioned and the ETT could be withdrawn by approximately 2 cm.
 2) Diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities likely representing moderate
 left heart failure.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: End stage renal disease with poor IV access. PICC line was attempted
 at bedside and was unsuccessful.

 RADIOLOGISTS PERFORMING PROCEDURE: This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **]
 and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2148**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**], the staff radiologist, was present throughout the
 entire procedure and supervised the procedure Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 135**] reviewed the case..

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:
 After the nature of the procedure, risks and benefits of doing/not doing the
 procedure and alternatives to the procedure were explained to the patient, he
 was given the opportunity to ask questions. Subsequently, informed consent was
 obtained.  Later, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed
 in supine position with the left arm abducted.  The left arm was prepped and
 draped in usual sterile fashion.  Because no superficial vessels were visible,
 ultrasonographic evaluation was performed.  Ultrasound demonstrated patent and
 compressible parabrachial veins.

 Under real-time ultrasonographic guidance a 21 gauge needle was introduced
 into the left brachial vein via an anesthetized skin site.  An 018 guidewire
 was passed retrograde under fluoroscopic guidance and the needle was exchanged
 for a 5 french dilator sheath.  The wire was then exchanged for the 018
 measuring guidewire, which was positioned into the superior vena cava and the
 inner dilator was exchanged for the appropriately trimmed 38 cm long 5 french
 single lumen Vaxcel brand PICC, which was positioned into the superior vena
 cava under fluruoscopic guidance.  The sheath was removed.  Good bidirectional
 flow was obtained and the catheter was flushed, capped and bandaged in place.
 A post procedural chest radiograph was obtained in order to document
 positioning.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: No contrast or medications were used for this
 examination.

 FINDINGS:
 1) Technically successful placement of a 38 cm, 5 french, single lumen Vaxcel
 brand PICC into the superior vena cava via the left medial brachial vein.

 COMPLICATIONS: There were no immediate complications.  The patient tolerated
 the procedure well and left the department in good condition.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Technically successful placement of a 5 french, 38 cm long, single lumen
 Vaxcel brand PICC into the superior vena cava via the left medial brachial
 vein.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
 Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of
 approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  No anginal type symptoms or ECG changes from
 baseline were noted.

 HISTORY:  H/o 3-vessel disease, s/p anterolateral wall myocardial infarction,
 LAD stenting and PTCA of D1, referred for CAD evaluation.

 INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion,
 MIBI was administered IV.

 Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
 Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Stress images show a severe perfusion defect in the anterior wall extending to
 the apex, which is predominantly fixed when correlated with the resting
 perfusion images.

 Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
 Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
 approximately 49%.  Akinesis in the region of the perfusion defect in the
 anterior wall and apex is demonstrated.

 Note is also made of a vague, ill-defined area of increased tracer activity in
 the right chest, which may represent increased soft tissue uptake.  Recommend
 clinical correlation to rule out mass lesion.

 IMPRESSION:  1) Severe, predominantly fixed perfusion defect in the anterior
 wall extending into the apex, with associated akinesis in this region and mildly
 decreased ejection fraction.  2) A vague, ill-defined area of increased tracer
 activity in the right chest, which may represent increased soft tissue uptake,
 recommend clinical correlation to rule out  mass lesion. /nkg

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Abdominal aortogram and right leg runoff [**2114-9-28**].

 HISTORY:  77 year old male with right foot ulceration and right lower
 extremity rest pain.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 512**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2148**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] (the Attending
 Radiologist) was present and supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  The procedure was explained to the patient and informed consent
 was obtained.  Since the patient could not tolerate lying flat for any length
 of time secondary to severe discomfort, the decision was made to use a left
 brachial artery approach.  Anesthesia was also consulted for MAC.

 The left arm was draped and prepped in the usual sterile manner, and using
 ultrasound guidance, the left brachial artery was accessed using a
 micropuncture needle.  A 0.018 guide wire was subsequently advanced into the
 left subclavian artery, and the needle was exchanged for a 4-French dilator.
 The 0.018 guide wire was then removed and an 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] guide wire was
 advanced into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance.  The dilator
 was then exchanged for a 4-French sheath over the guide wire.  A 4-French Omni
 Flush catheter was then advanced over the guide wire, and under fluoroscopic
 guidance, the tip was positioned in the proximal abdominal aorta.  An AP
 abdominal aortogram was performed.

 Under fluoroscopic guidance, the tip of the catheter was then repositioned
 just proximal to the iliac bifurcation.  A pelvic angiogram was performed in
 the left anterior oblique projection.

 The catheter was then exchanged for a 4-French Berenstein catheter over a
 0.035 guide wire.  The guide wire was then exchanged for a stiff Glidewire,
 which was advanced into the right common iliac artery.  Under fluoroscopic
 guidance, the guide wire was advanced into the right superficial femoral
 artery, however, the catheter could not be advanced over the wire.  The wire
 was therefore exchanged for a 0.035 Super Stiff Amplatz, which was advanced
 into the right superficial femoral artery and positioned there for stability.
 The Berenstein catheter was advanced over the guide wire, and the tip
 positioned in the right external iliac artery, under fluoroscopic guidance.

 (Cont)
 The guide wire was then removed and a right leg runoff was performed.

 ""Pull-back"" pressures were then obtained between the right external iliac
 artery, right common iliac artery, and distal abdominal aorta.

 The catheter and sheath were then removed, and manual compression applied to
 the left arm access site, until hemostasis was achieved.

 The patient received a total of 300 cc of non-ionic contrast secondary to his
 history of significant cardiovascular disease.

 The patient also received half an inch of nitro paste to the anterior chest
 wall for arterial spasm.  During the right leg runoff, he also received 100
 mcg of nitroglycerin intraarterially for arterial spasm.

 FINDINGS:  AP aortogram demonstrated a tortuous abdominal aorta without
 significant atherosclerotic disease.  Bilateral patent renal arteries and
 bilateral symmetric nephrograms were demonstrated.

 Pelvic angiogram demonstrated bilateral very tortuous iliac arteries, without
 significant atherosclerotic disease.  The internal iliac arteries were also
 patent and unremarkable.

 Right leg runoff demonstrated patent right common femoral artery and
 superficial femoral artery without significant atherosclerotic disease.  Mild-
 to-moderate atherosclerotic disease was present in the popliteal artery, but
 without significant stenoses.  Below the knee, there is occlusion of the
 proximal anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries.  The right peroneal
 artery is the only runoff to the lower leg, and demonstrates diffuse
 moderately- severe atherosclerotic disease throughout its course.  At the
 ankle, the peroneal artery reconstitutes the distal posterior tibial artery
 which supplies the plantar branches.  The peroneal artery also reconstitutes
 the dorsalis pedis artery, which is contiguous with the pedal arch.  Both
 reconstituted posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries are of good
 caliber, and without significant atherosclerotic disease.

 No hemodynamically significant pressure gradient was measured between the
 right external iliac artery, right common iliac artery, and distal abdominal
 aorta.

 The patient tolerated the procedure without complication.

 IMPRESSION:  Tortuous but unremarkable abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.
 Patent right common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.
 Occlusion of the proximal right anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries.
  Right peroneal artery only runoff to the right leg, with diffuse

 The heart size is enlarged in a predominantly left ventricular configuration
 with slight upper zone vascular redistribution.  There is a left pleural
 effusion.  There likely is also a right pleural effusion though no lateral
 view is available for confirmation.  There are bilateral infiltrates at the
 bases and the perihilar regions which are increased from 3 days ago.  There is
 evidence for left lower lobe collapse which is unchanged.  Calcification of
 the mitral anulus is again noted.

 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 515**], and [**Doctor First Name 4173**] [**Doctor Last Name 4174**]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4173**] [**Name (STitle) 4174**] (the staff radiologist) was
 present and supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was attempted to be obtained via telephone from
 the patient's mother. However, the patient's mother could not be reached at
 the availble phone number prior to the procedure. The right arm was prepped
 and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Using ultrasound, a patent and
 compressible right basilic vein was identified. Son[**Name (NI) 15**] guidance was used
 as no superficial veins were visible. The skin was anesthetized using 1%
 Lidocaine. Using a micropuncture set, the right basilic vein was accessed
 under son[**Name (NI) 15**] guidance. A 0.018 wire was advanced under fluoroscopic
 guidance with its tip in the lower SVC. A double lumen 5 French Vaxcel PICC
 line was measured and sized to 44 cm. Subsequently, the PICC line was advanced
 under fluoroscopic guidance over the wire with its tip in the lower SVC. The
 position of the PICC line was confirmed with a chest radiograph. The distal
 end of the PICC line was secured to the skin.

 CONTRAST: No intravenous contrast was administered.

 FINDINGS:
 Son[**Name (NI) 15**] evaluation of the right arm showed a patent and compressible right
 basilic vein. Fluoroscopic evaluation revealed the PICC line to be located
 with its tip in the lower SVC. A chest radiograph confirmed appropriate PICC
 position.

 COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION: Technically successful placement of a double lumen 5 French Vaxcel
 PICC line via the right basilic vein and with tip in the lower SVC. Total PICC
 line length of 44 cm. Line is available for immediate use.

 INDICATIONS:  Status post Swan-Ganz catheter placement.

 Comparison is made to the prior study of [**2114-9-27**].

 Findings:  Since the prior study there is a new Swan-Ganz line entering
 through the right neck with its tip well positioned within the right pulmonary
 artery.

 The patient again is noted to have an elevated right diaphrgam which is
 somewhat higher than on the prior study.  This may be postural as the patient
 is in a semi-recumbent position.  There are atelectatic changes in the lung
 adjacent to the elevated right hemidiaphragm.  There is some mildly prominent
 pulmonary vasculature in the upper lobes which could again be secondary to the
 patient's posture.

 There are no focal pulmonary opacifications or pleural effusions.  The cardiac
 silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 CLINICAL INDICATION: 77 year old status post central line placement over a
 wire confirm placement rule out pneumothorax.

 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated [**2114-10-2**].

 The current examination is slightly technically suboptimal due to overlying
 motion. In addition, lung volumes are markedly diminished which limits
 evaluation of the lung parenchyma. Linear and patchy opacities in the lower
 lung zones bilaterally most likely reflect patchy atelectasis although
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. The right hemidiaphragm continues to be
 elevated which is of uncertain significance. The right internal jugular Swan-
 Ganz catheter has been removed and now there is a right central venous line
 with its tip terminating near the junction of the superior vena cava with the
 right atrium. No pneumothorax is evident. Cardiac size and mediastinal
 contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation on the film.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Right internal jugular central venous line in good position. No
 pneumothorax.

 2. Markedly diminished lung volumes with patchy opacity at both lower lung
 zones which may reflect patchy atelectasis or pneumonia. Possible small left
 effusion.

 INDICATION: Sepsis. Check line placement.

 COMPARISON: [**2152-12-7**].

 PORTABLE AP CHEST: There has been interval placement of a right subclavian
 central venous catheter with tip at the cavo-atrial junction. No pneumothorax
 is seen. The lung volumes are low. The heart size is within normal limits.
 Prominence of the right hilum is likely due to vascular structures. There is
 left perihilar opacity raising question of acute aspiration event, and less
 likely pneumonia. No significant pleural effusion.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Right subclavian central line tip in cavo-atrial junction without
 pneumothorax.
 2. Left perihilar opacity could be from an acute aspiration event, and less
 likely pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATIONS: Clostridium Difficile colitis and malnutrition. Need for IV
 antibiotics and total parenteral nutrition.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 737**] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name 325**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6608**] [**Name (STitle) 1891**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
 [**Name (STitle) 325**], the staff radiologist was present for the whole procedure.

 MEDICATIONS:  Lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  No clinically accessible superficial veins could be
 visualized or palpated. Therefore, after sterile draping and prepping,
 ultrasound guidance was used to perform puncture of the left basilic vein with
 a 21-Gauge needle. A 0.018 guidewire was inserted through the needle and
 advanced to the SVC. The needle was removed and exchanged for a 5 French
 dilator and sheath system. Measurements were taken and a 5 French dual lumen
 PICC line was trimmed to 47 cm in length. The dilator was removed from the
 sheath and the PICC line was advanced over the wire up to the lower portion of
 the SVC. The guidewire was removed and the sheath was peeled away. An AP chest
 x-ray was taken to confirm appropriate catheter position. The PICC was afixed
 to the skin with a Stat-Lock device and dressings.

 COMPLICATIONS: No immediately complications observed.

 FINDINGS: Initial ultrasound exam showed a patent, fully compressible, left
 basilic vein and procedure radiograph shows the catheter in appropriate
 position, with its tip at the level of the lower portion of the SVC.

 IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 47 cm-long 5-French double lumen PICC
 line from a left basilic vein approach. The PICC is ready for immediate use.

 COMPARISON: Right upper quadrant US from same day.

 CT ABDOMEN, PELVIS:

 TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

 CONTRAST: 150 cc Optiray.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is bibasilar compressive atelectasis
 associated with bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 There is deformity to the right sided ribs.  This is associated with some
 focal pleural thickening.  There is a focal soft tissue nodule in the
 subcutaneous tissues inferior to the left breast. There is probable scarring
 manifested ad thickening subjancent to the sternal sutures and contiguous with
 the pericardium. The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
 unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended and there is stranding in the fat
 immediately adjacent to the gallbladder. The stomach and duodenum appear to be
 within normal limits and there is no free intraperitoneal air or fluid, nor is
 there is free intraperitoneal oral contrast material. No lymphadenopathy is
 identified. There are no gallstones identified.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Opacified bowel loops are unremarkable.  There is no
 free fluid or free air in the peritoneal cavity. There is no lymphadenopathy.
 The abdominal aorta and its major branches display calcification and small
 degree of mural thrombus.  The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber.  Osseous
 structures reveal multilevel degenerative changes.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of perforated duodenal ulcer.
 2. Minimal stranding in the inferior pericholecystic fat. Though there was no
 ultrasonographic evidence of cholecystitis, this may represent early
 cholecystitis.
 3. Right sided chest wall rib deformity with associated pleural thickening.
 4. Bilateral small pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
 5. Soft tissue nodule of uncertain significance as described above. Clinical
 correlation is advised.

 PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to film from one day earlier. There is
 limited evaluation of cardiac and mediastinal contours due to portable
 technique and rotation. There is hazy increased density in both lung bases
 with poor definition of both lateral costophrenic angles, findings suggesting
 small bilateral pleural effusions, which may be layering somewhat posteriorly.
 It is difficult to entirely exclude the possibility of pneumonia, particularly
 at the left lung base. There are scattered areas of plate-like atelectasis in
 the left hemithorax.

 IMPRESSION: 1. Scattered foci of subsegmental atelectasis left hemithorax.
 2. Findings suggesting small bilateral pleural effusions. Note that it is
 difficult to exclude pneumonia on the lung bases on the current film.

 PA/lateral views would be useful if possible.

 ADDENDUM: The small left apical pneumothorax noted yesterday is no longer
 seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Increased O2 requirement and diffuse rhonchi, evaluate for
 pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema.

 Single frontal chest radiograph dated [**2115-6-19**] is compared with prior chest
 radiograph dated [**2115-6-17**]. The cardiac silhouette is again enlarged, with
 straightening of the left cardiac contour. This raises the question of
 pericardial effusion. There is persistent CHF, evidenced by a perihilar and
 perivascular haziness. There is also a right pleural effusion, intervally
 increased since the prior study. Left base atelectasis is again visualized, of
 no significant interval change.

 Multiple left rib deformities again visualized, indicative of prior fractures.

 IMPRESSION: Enlarged cardiac silhouette with CHF and right pleural effusion. A
 pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. Left base atelectasis.

 SINGLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH dated [**2115-6-17**] is compared with prior chest
 radiograph dated [**2115-6-12**]. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable
 compared with prior study allowing for difference in lung volumes. There is
 prominent pulmonary vascularity, perivascular and perihilar haziness,
 indicative of CHF. No definite focal parenchymal consolidation is visualized.
 No definite pleural effusion is present on this frontal view.

 Again multiple rib deformities in the left chest wall with probable associated
 pleural thickening are present, consistent with prior trauma. There is also
 asymmetric left apical thickening, of no interval change since the prior study
 of [**2112**]. The trachea appears somewhat deviated to the left, but probably due
 to patient's rotation on this film.

 IMPRESSION: Mild CHF.

 HISTORY: 71 y/o woman with a sternal wound infection requiring parental
 antibiotic therapy.

 RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 178**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 179**] [**Doctor Last Name 180**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 179**] [**Name (STitle) 180**], the
 attending radiologist, was present and supervised the procedure.

 TECHNIQUE: The procedure was explained to the patient and informed consent was
 obtained. The left arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.
 Ultrasound examination was performed as no accessible vein could be seen nor
 palpated. It showed a patent, fully compressible left basilic vein.
 Using ultrasound guidance, and following administration of 1% Lidocaine for
 local anesthesia, the left basilic vein was accessed using a micropuncture
 needle. A 0.018 guide wire was subsequently advanced into the superior vena
 cava under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was then exchanged for the PICC
 introducer sheath, and a single lumen 4 French PICC, trimmed to 37 cm, was
 advanced over the wire and the tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic
 guidance. The introducer sheath and guide wire were subsequently removed and
 catheter hub was afixed to the skin using the Stat-Lock system. A sterile
 dressing was applied. A chest radiograph was obtained to document catheter
 position.

 COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.

 FINDINGS: Ultrasound examination demonstrated patent and compressible brachial
 vein, with normal surrounding anatomy.

 Post placement chest radiograph demonstrated the catheter tip in the distal
 SVC.

 IMPRESSION: Technically successful placement of a 4 French single lumen PICC
 (37 cm long) via the left brachial vein. Catheter tip in distal SVC, confirmed
 by chest radiograph. The PICC can be used immediately.

 INDICATION:  Trauma, MVA.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet through the iliac
 crest without contrast.  The smart prep technique was utilized to optimize
 contrast within the aorta.  CT images were then acquired from the thoracic
 inlet through the aortic bifurcation using 150 cc of iv Optiray.  Delayed
 images of the pelvis were aquired.  Multiplanar reformatted images were
 performed for further evaluation.

 CT CHEST W&W/O CONTRAST;  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There
 are patchy densities within the right upper lobe, which may represent
 contusion.  There is a non-enhancing soft tissue density in the anterior
 mediastinum which may represent the thymus, but a small bleed with no active
 extravasation cannot be excluded.  There is a 4 mm nodular density within the
 right upper lobe of uncertain significance. The heart, aorta and major
 pulmonary arteries appear normal. There is no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An
 ET tube is present.

 CT ABDOMEN W&W/O CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands,
 pancreas, stomach and visualized portions of large and small bowel are
 unremarkable.  The gallbladder appears normal.  There is no free air or fluid
 within the abdomen.

 CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  The bladder and visualized portions of large and small
 bowel are unremarkable.  There is a small right groin hematoma.  There is no
 free air or free fluid within the pelvis.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There is pubic diastasis measuring 13 mm with small adjacent
 ossific fragments, unlikely representing an acute injury.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  No evidence of aortic dissection.

 2)  Small bilateral pleural effusions and patchy densities within the right
 upper lobe which may represent contusion.  A 4 mm nodular density within the
 right upper lobe may also represent contusion, but follow-up is recommended to
 ensure resolution.

 3)  13 mm pubic diastasis probably related to old injury or childbirth. Please
 correlate with clinical history.

 EXAM:  Chest CT.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  41 year old woman three weeks status post gastric bypass
 surgery.  Acute shortness of breath and chest pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 lung bases to the lung apices following the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was administered per the fast bolus
 nature of the exam.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 FINDINGS:  Inspection of the pulmonary arteries reveals large bilateral
 filling defects within the right and left main pulmonary arteries consistent
 with large bilateral pulmonary emboli.  The heart is within normal limits and
 there is no pericardial effusion.  There are no pleural effusions.  Lung
 windows reveal clear lungs with no focal areas of consolidation.  No pulmonary
 nodules are identified.  The osseous structures reveal degenerative changes
 but no destructive bone lesions are seen.

 films from  [**2117-10-21**].  The left IJ central line tip is well positioned in mid
 SVC.  No evidence of any associated pneumothorax can be identified. However,
 there is a curvilinear streak of gas beneath the left diaphragm.  This could
 represent free gas in the peritoneal cavity, raising the question of bowel
 perforation.  No other significant cardiopulmonary abnormality can be

 [**Doctor Last Name 325**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 325**] (staff radiologist) being present and
 supervising.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The left upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion. Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound
 was used for localization. The basilic vein demonstrates only partial
 compressibility in a focal region along the mid upper arm region. The vessel
 is compressible above this point and patent. After local anesthesia with 2 cc
 of 1% Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance
 with a 21 gauge needle. An 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into
 the superior vena cava. Based on the markers on the guidewire it was
 determined that a length of 42 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was trimmed
 to length and advanced over a 4 French introducer sheath. The sheath was
 removed and the catheter was flushed. A final chest x-ray was obtained
 demonstrating the tip to be in the superior vena cava, just above the atrium.
 The line is ready for use. A StatLock was applied and the line was heplocked.

 IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 42 cm-long, 5 French, double lumen PICC
 line from a high left basilic access vein with tip in the superior vena cava,
 ready for use.
 Incidentally noted was a focal thrombus in the left basilic vein of the mid
 upper arm. The vessel appears patent proximal to this region.

 UPRIGHT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again demonstrated are sternal wires, surgical
 clips, and a left sided pacemaker/AICD. A right internal jugular central
 venous line is also demonstrated, position unchanged. The heart size is
 enlarged with a slight increase in the redistribution of pulmonary blood flow
 to the upper lobes, consistent with slightly worsened left ventricular
 failure. There has been increase in the amount of left lower lobe collapse
 with further elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The left pleural effusion is
 slightly enlarged since the prior study. There are also patchy opacities
 within the right mid lung zones which have increased in intensity, and likely
 represent focal areas of atelectasis. The osseous structures are unchanged.

 IMPRESSION: Slightly worsened heart failure. Further collapse of left lower
 lobe and increasing left pleural effusion.

 FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright image provided. Comparison study dated
 [**2153-11-19**]. The ETT and the NG tube appear to be in satisfactory position. The
 heart shows fairly marked left ventricular enlargement. Dual chamber pacemaker
 electrodes are noted, in satisfactory position. There is a fairly large left
 sided pleural effusion with collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe
 behind the heart. The heart and mediastinum are displaced to the right due to
 the effusion. Midline sternal sutures are noted, presumably related to a prior
 CABG procedure.

 These findings are not significantly changed since the prior study.

 IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly associated with a large left pleural effusion and
 there is collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe. Findings essentially
 unchanged.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  78 year old woman with pancreatic cancer.  Requires PICC
 line for long-term access and antibiotic therapy.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 34428**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the Staff Radiologist,
 was present and supervising the entire procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Informed written consent was obtained from the patient.  The left
 upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  As no
 superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was utilized to identify an
 appropriate vein for cannulation.  Anesthesia was obtained with 1% lidocaine.
 The left basilic vein appeared widely patent and compressible.  Using a
 micropuncture needle, the left basilic vein was cannulated under ultrasound
 guidance and a 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the needle under
 fluoroscopic guidance into the lower SVC.  A 4-French single-lumen PICC was
 trimmed to a total length of 42 cm and was advanced over the wire into the
 lower SVC.  The line was affixed to the skin with a Stat-Lock device.  A post-
 procedure chest x-ray was obtained which demonstrates the tip of the PICC to
 be appropriate located in the lower SVC.  The patient tolerated the procedure
 well and there were no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of single-lumen 4-French 42-cm PICC via left
 basilic vein with tip in the lower SVC.  The line is ready for immediate use.

 HISTORY: 66 year old woman with shortness of breath. Evaluate for PE.

 TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the lungs were obtained following the
 administration of 100 cc of Optiray. The exam was severely limited by patient
 motion as well as lack of peripheral venous access which limited bolus
 administration.

 There are no definite filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature to indicate
 pulmonary embolism. However, the study is limited by lack of adequate bolus
 and patient motion as described above. There are multiple patchy peripheral
 opacities in the right middle and right lower lobe, could be indicative of
 early pneumonia. There are calcifications in the aorta and in the coronary
 arteries. No pneumothorax is seen. There is no significant mediastinal or
 axillary lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusions are identified.

 Bone windows: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

 IMPRESSION: No definite pulmonary embolism identified, however, the study is
 limited by factors described above. If clinically indicated, a VQ scan could
 be obtained. 2. Patchy peripheral opacities in the right middle and right
 lower lobe, which could indicate early pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  Check status of central line and ET tube placement.  R/O ptx.

 SINGLE AP FILM:  The tip of the right IJ central line is at the SVC/RA
 junction.  The ET tube is satisfactorily positioned 3 cm above the carina. The
 NG line is difficult to visualize, but its tip appears to be in the lower
 esophagus behind the heart.  It should be advanced and further follow-up study
 would be helpful to check its position.  The heart again shows LV enlargement.
 There is decrease lung volumes and small bilateral effusions are noted.  There
 is also evidence of collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe behind the
 heart.  S/P CABG surgery is noted.

 IMPRESSION: NG tube appears to be intraesophageal and should be advanced.
 Other lines appear satisfactory.  LV enlargement, left lower lobe
 collapse/consolidation and decreased lung volumes noted.  Bilateral effusions.

 CHEST ONE VIEW.

 INDICATION:  S/P CABG.

 COMMENT:  Portable ap radiograph of the chest is reviewed and compared with
 previous study  of yesterday.

 The patient is s/p CABG and median sternotomy.  The tip of the ET tube is
 identified 4 cm above the carina.  The mediastinal drain remains in place.  A
 right jugular SG catheter terminates in the right main PA.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  An NG tube courses in the stomach.  Again note is made of a
 moderate size right pleural effusion with decreased lung volumes with
 atelectasis of the middle lobe.  Comparion with preoperative chest radiograph
 is recommended.  There is probably a very mild pulmonary edema in the left
 lung with a small left pleural effusion and patchy atelectasis in the left
 lung base.

 The radiograph is somewhat suboptimal due to patient body habitus.

 AP CHEST:  In comparison to prior study of [**2132-7-27**], the NG tube has
 been retracted, and the sideport now lies above the level of the diaphragm. An
 endotracheal tube is in unchanged position below the thoracic inlet. A left
 subclavian line terminates in the mid-SVC. A small right pleural effusion and
 patchy areas of right upper lobe and left lower lobe opacification are
 unchanged from the prior study. Patchy perihilar opacities are consistent with
 persistent mild pulmonary edema.

 COMPARISON is made to prior exam of [**2132-6-19**].

 FINDINGS:  Patient is s/p median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart is within
 normal limits for size.  Since the prior exam, there is a  slight increase in
 pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral interstitial opacities.  There is
 fluid in the right minor fissure, as well as blunting of the right CP angle
 and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with moderate size right
 effusion with pulmonic component.  Right-sided volume loss is also likely
 related to partial right lower lobe collapse.  There is likely also a residual
 small left effusion.

 AP CHEST:  The endotracheal tube is approximately 1.4 cm above the carina; the
 slightly inferior location is probably related to neck flexure.  An NG tube
 extends into the stomach and off the margin of the film.  An inferiorly placed
 PA cath terminates in the descending portion of the left pulmonary artery.
 Chain sutures in the right lung are consistent with previous partial
 resection.  Sternotomy wires are midline.  The heart size and mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Diffuse increased interstitial
 markings in both lungs are more prominent on the right, and a right pleural
 effusion has increased in size in comparison to the prior study of [**2132-7-21**].
 There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right pleural effusion and asymmetric diffuse lung
 opacities, greater on the right.  Although the findings could represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, a multifocal pneumonia is also possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  64 year old woman with end stage renal disease requiring
 permacath placement for hemodialysis.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 30992**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 29638**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29638**] being present and
 supervising.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was taken to the Angiography Suite on
 [**2155-10-31**], where her right neck and chest were prepped and draped in standard
 sterile fashion.  The right internal jugular vein was patent and compressible
 by ultrasound.  After administration of subcutaneous lidocaine, the right
 internal jugular vein was accessed with a #21 gauge needle using son[**Name (NI) 211**]
 guidance. A .018 guide wire was advanced into the superior vena cava. The
 needle was exchanged for a #4 French sheath.  The .018 guide wire was
 exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire, which was advanced over the sheath through to the
 inferior vena cava.  The tunnel site was identified and the potential tract
 was infused with subcutaneous lidocaine.  A small incision was made with the
 scalpel at the catheter exit site in the right upper chest.  A #14.5 French 28
 cm total length, 23 cm cuff to tip dialysis catheter was attached to the
 tunneling device and advanced from the right upper chest incision through to
 the right internal jugular access site.  The right IJ was then progressively
 dilated to #14 French with the dilator set.  The dialysis catheter sheath was
 then advanced over the [**Doctor Last Name 539**] wire.  The dialysis catheter was then placed into
 the right IJ through the sheath and the sheath was peeled away.  The tip of
 the catheter was placed in the right atrium.  The neck incision was then
 closed with #4.0 Vicryl deep dermal stitches.  The catheter was secured with
 #0 silk sutures.  The catheter was flushed, demonstrating good flow, and then
 Hep- locked.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
 immediate post procedure complications.  The patient was then taken for chest
 x-ray, which demonstrated good placement of the catheter with tip in the right
 atrium and no evidence of pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of #14.5 French 23 cm cuff to tip tunneled
 hemodialysis catheter through a right IJ access.  The line is ready for use.

 INDICATION:  Trauma, struck by car, bilateral chest tubes.

 COMPARISON:  [**2108-11-7**].

 SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP:  The right subclavian CVL tip is seen within the distal
 SVC.  No pneumothoraces.  There are bilateral chest tubes.  The left chest
 tube appears to coil anteriorly in a odd projection.  There are bilateral
 perihilar interstitial and alveolar opacities.  There is again seen widening
 of the superior mediastinum.  The aortic arch is obscured.  The ET tube and NG
 tube are in unchanged position.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.
 There is a persistent left sided pleural effusion.

 IMPRESSION:  1. Right subclavian CVL tip within the dital SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
              2. Persistent widening of the mediastinum obscuring the aortic
 arch.  Although possibly reflecting vascular distention, this finding is
 concerning for vascular injury in a trauma patient, and recommend further
 evaluation of the mediastinum with dedicated CT angiography study. These
 findings were discussed with the trauma team.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices through
 the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast IV.
 IV CONTRAST: 150 cc of Optiray.  Optiray was used per trauma protocol.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a crycothyrotomy with a tube placed within
 the trachea and associated air within the soft tissues of the anterior neck.
 The heart appears enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. The great
 vessels are unremarkable. Specifically there is no evidence of aortic injury.
 There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. There are bilateral
 pulmonary contusions, posteroapical on the right and apical and anterior on
 the left. There are no pleural effusions. There is a small pneumothorax in the
 left lower anterior chest. Bilateral chest tubes are present, the left chest
 tube appears coiled and kinked in the mid lung region. There is bibasilar
 atelectasis. Subcutaneous air is noted along the left chest wall consistent
 with chest tube placement.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a homogeneous fluid collection located
 above the dome of the liver with [**Doctor Last Name **] measuring 50.  As the contour of this
 collection tracks along the diaphragm but does not track superior along the
 pleura, this is felt to be subdiaphragmatic.  The adjacent hepatic parenchyma
 is normal without evidence of laceration.  The liver is notable for a small
 left lobe.  Otherwise no focal abnormalities are seen. There is no intra or
 extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
 adrenal glands, and bowel loops are unremarkable.  There are several simple
 cysts associated with the mid and lower right kidney. Otherwise the kidneys
 are unremarkable.  There is an area of mesenteric stranding in the mid left
 abdomen with no thickening of adjacent bowel loops.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The sigmoid colon, rectum, and urinary bladder are
 unremarkable.  There are bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias.  There is
 no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  In the fat of the right ischiorectal fossa
 there is some ill defined stranding of the fat.

 (Cont)
 There are no fractures or other suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

 Multiplanar reformations were obtained through the chest and upper abdomen
 which helped define the above described pathology.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Bilateral pulmonary contusions.
 2) Unusual high attenuation uniform fluid collection beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm abutting the liver. Given the setting of trauma, this is
 concerning for a hemorrhage, though of note there is no adjacent rib fracture
 and no focal abnormalities in the liver to suggest a laceration.  This
 potentially could be related to iatrogenic injury from chest tube placement.
 An ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.
 3) Two areas of nonspecific fat stranding, one mesenteric in the left mid
 abdomen without associated bowel loop abnormalities and one in the right
 ischiorectal fossa. The mesenteric region is concerning for acute
 mesenteric injury and there could be injury to the adjacent bowel, though
 there is no evidence of perforation.  The differential diagnosis of these
 findings include contusion in the setting of trauma vs infectious or
 inflammatory process.
 4) Cardiomegaly.
 5) Simple cysts right kidney.

 limits fine evaluation.  There are sternal wires and an NG tube with the tip
 not definitely visualized, but below the diaphragm.  Trauma board limits fine
 osseous evaluation.  Superior mediastinal contours are very sharp, but
 slightly prominent.  This is probably due to supine technique.  Multifocal
 left lung atelectasis is present.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a left
 pleural effusion.  There is sharp angulation of the left 3rd rib posteriorly
 which may indicate a fracture.

 PORTABLE CHEST:

 Compared to 1 day earlier.

 INDICATION: Increasing oxygen requirement. Shortness of breath.

 The heart is enlarged. The pulmonary vascularity is engorged, and there is a
 bilateral predominantly interstitial pattern. A more confluent area of opacity
 in the right lower lung zone has improved in the interval.

 IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure pattern with interstitial edema. Rapidly
 resolving alveolar process in right lower lobe may relate to asymmetric edema
 or resolving aspiration.

 INDICATION: Shortness of breath.

 COMPARISON: Compared with one day earlier.

 FINDINGS: The exam is limited by respiratory motion and incomplete imaging of
 the lungs, with exclusion of the extreme lateral aspect of the lung bases
 bilaterally.  The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There is upper zone
 vascular redistribution.  There is asymmetrical perihilar haziness on the
 right with a developing area of confluent consolidation in the right
 infrahilar region.

 IMPRESSION: Asymmetric perihilar opacity in the right lung, likely due to
 asymmetric pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure.  However, a
 superimposed process such as aspiration  or developing pneumonia in the right
 lower lobe is also possible.

 FINDINGS: Portable AP view of the chest obtained with patient in semierect
 position demonstrates persistence of the previously described total right-
 sided chest opacification. Also the previously placed chest tube is in
 unchanged position. Local areas of air collection were believed to be portions
 of highly placed colon in right superhepatic position. Possibility of asbcess
 formation in this area must also be considered. There is no significant
 mediastinal shift toward either side. The left lung remains aerated without
 evidence of congestive pattern but there is blunting of the left lateral
 pleural sinus by pleural effusion and diffuse density in the lower left-sided
 chest portion is compatible with fluid layering posteriorly. No pneumothorax
 is identified around the left apical region.

 IMPRESSION: Persistent white- out of right hemithorax. Also evidence of
 pleural effusion on left side. For better detail evaluation of process a chest
 CT appears to be the imaging procedure of choice.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pleural effusions.  Lung CA.

 Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax, and there remains
 complete opacification of the right hemithorax.  There is an endobronchial
 stent present in the right main stem and bronchus intermedius regions.  The ET
 tube tube has been removed in the interval.  There is mild narrowing of the
 trachea at the thoracic inlet level.  A moderate to large left pleural
 effusion is present and cannot be fully assessed due to incomplete imaging of
 the left lung peripherally.  There is associated left retrocardiac opacity,
 likely due to adjacent collapse.  Diffuse haziness of the soft tissues, as
 well as the imaged portion of the upper abdomen suggest the possibility of
 anasarca and ascites respectively.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Complete opacification of the right hemithorax, consistent with persistent
 right lung collapse and effusion.

 2. Moderate to large left pleural effusion, probably increased in the
 interval, although incomplete imaging of the left lung and lack of information
 regarding positioning of the patient limit assessment.

 3. Probable anasarca and ascites.

 HISTORY:  Bilateral pulmonary embolus without defineable DVT;

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial pre and post contrast CT abdomen with post contrast CT of
 the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated [**2119-2-15**].

 FINDINGS:

 There has been interval worsening of a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 1174**] interstitial abnormality
 within the right lower and right middle lobe relative to the prior study. This
 is suggestive of an infectious etiology and possibly multifocal atypical
 pneumonia.

 Within the left upper lobe, there is an irregular 1 cm nodule which is stable
 relative to the prior study.  Although this could be infectious in nature, it
 could also represent a  malignancy, and therefore follow up is recommended in
 six months.

 The patient's pulmonary embolism is again visualized.

 There is extensive coronary artery calcification.

 PRE AND POST CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN:  The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenals
 are normal in appearance.

 There is a cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney measures 2.3 x 2.1 cm.
 The right kidney is otherwise normal in appearance.  There is excretion from
 the right kidney without hydronephrosis on the delayed images.

 The left kidney is absent with surgical clips at the expected origin of the
 left renal artery.  This should be correlated for a history of the etiology of
 the patient's prior nephrectomy.

 No pathologically enlarged abdominal lymph nodes.  No ascites or
 pneumoperitoneum.

 POST CONTRAST CT PELVIS:  No abnormally thickened or dilated pelvic bowel

 air.  No pelvic ascites, lymphadenopathy, or pneumoperitoneum.

 It should be noted that there is extensive atherosclerotic disease of the
 abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 There is evidence of a left iliac bone graft donor site, noting the presence
 of transpedicular screws in the lower lumbar spine with bone chips from the
 prior surgery.  There is extensive atherosclerotic disease.

 FINDINGS:

 1)  Interval worsening of a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 1174**] interstitial abnormality within the
 right middle and lower lobes consistnet wtih an infectious etiology.

 2)  1 cm left upper lobe lung nodule for which six month follow up is
 recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A 27-year-old woman with endstage renal disease on hemodialysis via
 right temporary IJ dialysis catheter.  The patient needs permanent venous
 access for hemodialysis.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1035**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1036**] [**Name (STitle) 1037**], the attending radiologist
 present and supervising throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA/MEDICAITONS:  Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine and intravenous
 conscious sedation with divided doses of Versed and Fentanyl were given under
 continuous monitoring.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Informed written consent was obtained.  The patient was
 brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the angiography table.
 The right neck and upper chest were prepped and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion.  2.5 cc of blood were withdrawn from dialysis port of the existing
 right internal jugular temporary dialysis catheter.  A .035 [**Last Name (un) 4540**] guide wire
 was then advanced through one of the ports and into the inferior vena cava.
 The temporary dialysis catheter was then removed over the wire and exchanged
 for a  Peel-Away sheath. Subcutaneous tunnel was then made in the anterior
 chest wall and dialysis catheter advanced throught the tunnel exiting at the
 neck incision. The catheter was then advanced through the sheath.  The sheath
 was then peeled away. The catheter was then positioned under fluoroscopy.  A
 post- procedure film was obtained which demonstrated the tip of the dialysis
 catheter to be in the right atrium. The ports were aspirated and flushed with
 ease.  Neck incision was closed with a suture. The catheter was secured to the
 skin with an 0- Prolene suture. The line is ready for immediate use.

 COMPLICATIONS:  None.

 IMPRESSION:  successful conversion from a temporary non-tunneled right IJ
 catheter to a tunneled dual-lumen dialysis catheter.  The line is ready for
 immediate use.

 INDICATION:  Tylenol overdose, status post TLC in right IJ vein, now with low-
 grade temperture, cough and sputum.  Evaluate for pulmonary abnormalities.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view obtained with patient in upright position
 demonstrates a heart silhouette which clearly indicates mild cardiac
 enlargement.  No typical configurational abnormality is present.  The thoracic
 aorta is unremarkable in width and contours.  The pulmonary vasculature may
 have a mild degree of upper zone redistribution pattern, but there exists no
 interstitial or acute pulmonary edema.  No acute parenchymal infiltrates are
 present and the lateral pleural sinuses are free.  Comparison is made with a
 previous similar portable chest exam dated Debember 30, [**2126**].  It indicates
 that the previously present ordinary right IJ central venous line has been
 replaced with a wide-bore double-lumen device terminating at the level of the
 carina.  A new left-sided subclavian approach central venous line is also
 present and seen to terminate in the lower half of the SVC, just above the
 expected entrance into the right atrium.  Unchanged appearance of the
 previously described right-sided metallic nipple ornament.

 The dimension of the heart shadow has increased during the last nine-day
 interval.  In the absence of other significant changes and pulmonary
 congestion and possibility of pericardial effusion should be considered.

 HISTORY:  76 year old man with sudden onset of desaturation and diapharesis.
 Rule out PE.

 COMPARISON:  Not available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images of the chest were obtained with
 150 cc Optiray.  Nonionic IV contrast was used secondary to fast bolus
 injection required for the study.

 CT CHEST W/IV CONTRAST:  The heart appears unremarkable.  There are multiple
 intraluminal filling defects noted at the level of the right main pulmonary
 artery bifurcation.  Thrombus is identified within the pulmonary arteries
 supplying the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, as well as right lower
 lobe.  Contrast is noted distal to the thrombi.  On the left side,
 intraluminal filling defect is noted at the subsegmental level, within the
 pulmonary artery that is supplying the left lower lobe.  There is no
 significant hilar, mediastinal, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Within the right
 middle lobe there is slightly increased lung marking, with a focal area of
 opacity, which could represent focal atelectasis.  The remainder of the lungs
 appear unremarkable.  The airway appears to be patent to the level of
 segmental bronchi bilaterally.

 The visualized portion of the abdomen demonstrates a small 1.8 X 1.2 cm soft
 tissue density just lateral to the transverse colon, which could represent a
 splenule, however the splenule is not imaged on this CT chest.

 Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Bilateral pulmonary embolism involving the right upper lobe, right middle
 lobe, right lower lobe, and the left lower lobe.  Discussed with the surgical
 team at the time of the study.

 2)  Focal right middle lobe opacity, which could represent focal atelectasis
 vs. infectious etiology.  Please correlate clinically.

 3)  There is likely a small splenule noted in the left upper quadrant, however
 the spleen is not imaged on this CTA of the chest.

  stenting of RML now with worsening oxygenation intubated on 100%
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Staging of non-small cell lung ca s/p RMSB stent
 No contraindications for IV contrast
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer which obstructs the right main stem
 bronchus with total right lung collapse. Status-post stenting of right middle
 lobe, now with worsening oxygenation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images are obtained through the chest after the
 administration of 100cc Optiray. Non-ionic contrast was used secondary to
 patient debility.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is total collapse of the right lung. A stent is
 identified in the right main stem bronchus, as well as the region of the
 bronchus intermedius. There is a large right pleural effusion. Also noted is a
 moderate-large left pleural effusion. A right-sided chest tube is in place and
 there are small bubbles of gas along the tract of the tube. The size
 of the extensive tumor in the right chest is difficult to ascertain due to the
 collapsed lung and pleural effusion. There is a non-obstructing thrombus
 identified in the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC. There may also be tumor
 involvement of the right atrium.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal slight fullness of the left adrenal
 gland. There is fluid in Morison's pouch.

 Lung windows demonstrate no focal lesions in the aerated portion of the left
 lung. There is collapse of the left lower lobe.

 Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormalities.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Complete collapse of the right lung with a stent identified in the right
 main stem bronchus. The extent of tumor is difficult to determine due to the
 right lung collapse and large right pleural effusion.
 2) Left lower lobe collapse and moderate-large left pleural effusion.
 3) Non-occlusive thrombus in the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC. There may
 be tumor involvement of the heart.

 CT TORSO WITHOUT CONTRAST

 INDICATION: Fever and aspiration pneumonia. Evaluate for abscess.

 TECHNIQUE: CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed without IV
 contrast.  No contrast was administered due to the lack of IV access.

 CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  Marked atherosclerotic calcification is present in the
 abdominal aorta and coronary arteries.  A right sided PICC line terminates at
 the SVC/right atrial junction.  There is no evidence of pathologic axillary or
 hilar lymph node enlargement.  There are several prominent mediastinal lymph
 nodes.  There is evidence of a parenchymal consolidation with air bronchograms
 within both lung bases (right greater than left).  There is a tiny right sided
 pleural effusion.  The remainder of the lungs are clear with no evidence of
 pulmonary nodules or pneumothorax.

 CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST: Visualization of the liver is obscured by streak
 artifact from the patient's overlying arm. A G tube is in place. The spleen,
 pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable on this study limited
 by the lack of IV contrast.  There is no evidence of dilatation or wall
 thickening within large or small bowel.  Oral contrast reaches the transverse
 colon indicating no evidence of obstruction.  There is evidence of extensive
 calcification within the abdominal aorta and its visceral branches.  The
 abdominal aorta is of normal caliber.  There is no free air, free fluid, or
 definite intraabdominal abscess seen.

 CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, prostate, and rectum are within
 normal limits.  Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Pulmonary parenchymal consolidation within both lower lobes (right greater
 than left).

 2) No evidence of acute intraabdominal pathology on this study limited by the
 lack of IV contrast and by suboptimal patient positioning.

 FINDINGS:

 An NG tube is present, with the tip in the stomach. The tip of an endotracheal
 tube is approximately 3cm above the carina.

 Prominence of cardiac silhouette likely reflects a combination of
 cardiomegaly, supine positioning, and bibasilar collapse/consilidation. There
 is a slight prominence of pulmonary vasculature, without overt failure.
 Possible very small pleural effusions bilaterally.

 CHEST CT WITHOUT/WITH IV CONTRAST:

 INDICATION:  History of resected lung cancer with CHF and question of
 lymphangetic spread.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast images were obtained through the chest including
 supine inspiration and expiration HRCT images at 1.25 mm of collimation.
 Additionally, 5 mm collimated helically acquired images were obtained through
 the chest after 75 cc of optiray.

 Coronal reformats were created.

 CONTRAST:  Non-ionic contrast was provided given the patient's generalized
 debility.

 There is no prior CT excamiantion of the chest for comparison.

 CT OF THE CHEST BEFORE/AFTER IV CONTRAST:

 There are no enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes.  A non-
 pathologically enlarged left hilar lymph node measures 7 x 13 mm (series 11,
 image 24).  Stensor seen within the left coronary artery.  There is a tiny
 inferior/anterior paracardial effusion.

 There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with
 loculations in the left effusion which tracks laterally.  The patient is post
 right thoracotomy and there has been resection of the right middle lobe.
 There is a geographically marginated area of consolidation with traction
 bronchiectasis along the medial portion of the right lung, including the right
 lower lobe and anterior segment of the right upper lobe.  There is diffuse
 interstitial thickening and ground glass opacities, most prominent and
 confluent within the right upper lobe.  Surgical clips are seen within the
 right hilum, and pleural based calcifications are seen at the right lung base.
  Mild emphysematous changes are seen bilaterally.

 There is a 2.6 cm left thyroid nodule which extends inferiorly into the

 prevascular space.  Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.  Both
 adrenal glands are imaged and appear normal.

 The coronal images were useful for visualizing the geographic distribution of
 interstitial thickening.

 IMPRESSION:

 1)  Bilateral asymmetrical distribution of interstitial thickening and ground
 glass opacities, most prominent within the right upper lobe.  When compared to
 chest radiographs dating back to [**Month (only) 1528**], the rapid development of these changes
 is most suggestive of an acute process such as pneumonia or asymmetric
 pulmonary edema. Less likely considerations are lymphangitic carcinomatosis
 and drug toxicity.

 2)  Areas of consolidation within the medial right lung are consistent with
 post-radiation changes. Status post right middle lobectomy.

 3)  2.6 cm left thyroid nodule which extends inferiorly into the prevascular
 space.  A thyroid ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.

 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP OF THE CHEST:  There is again present an endotracheal tube,
 left-sided subclavian line, Swan-Ganz catheter and NG tube in stable position.
  The heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There has been significant
 interval improvement in the diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar
 opacities.  There is a persistent right upper lobe opacity with mild volume
 loss suggesting focal atelectasis or aspiration.  The left costophrenic angle

 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH:

 COMPARISON: [**5-31**] and [**2147-6-11**].

 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There has been an
 increase in interstitial edema seen in both lung fields.  In addition, there
 is increasing opacification in the left retrocardiac region with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm.  Round alveolar opacities are essentially
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified on this radiograph.  Tracheostomy
 tube and left central venous catheter as well as NG tube are all unchanged in
 position.

 IMPRESSION:

 Persistent background of alveolar air space opacification consistent with
 ARDS.  The marked increase in interstitial pattern in the short interval from
 the prior study suggests a superimposed element of congestive heart failure.
 Increasing consolidation/collapse at the left lower lobe.

 INDICATION:  Increasing shortness of breath.  Right scapular pain, evaluate
 for pulmonary embolism.

 COMPARISON:  [**2140-1-4**].

 TECHNIQUE:  A CT angiogram of the chest with coronal and sagittal
 reconstructions was performed.  Helically acquired axial images were obtained
 through the chest before and after the administration of 100 cc of nonionic
 Optiray contrast.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary to the fast bolus
 nature of the exam.

 CT OF THE CHEST W/WO CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, right-sided greater than left.  These
 appear increased from the previous study.  There is also evidence of tracking
 within the fissures as well as a subpulmonic component of the left pulmonary
 effusion.  There is reactive atelectasis at both lung bases.  There are
 multiple areas of consolidation with ground-glass opacities consistent with
 multi-focal pneumonia.  There is also mild septal thickening throughout
 consistent with mild left ventricular heart failure.

 The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. Note is again made of extensive
 coronary calcifications. There is extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy which
 appears slightly increased when compared with the previous study.  The largest
 mediastinal nodes are identified within the prevascular space with an
 approximately 1.4 cm lymph node as well as the paratracheal and subcarinal
 areas with 1.8 cm nodes. There is also evidence of hilar nodes which are
 slightly obscured by the pleural fluid tracking within this area.  There is no
 significant axillary lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent down to the
 segmental bronchi.

 Limited examination of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Bone windows again
 show degenerative changes within the thoracic spine.

 Compared to [**2140-1-4**].

 INDICATION: Shortness of breath. Recent history of pneumonia.

 The heart is upper limits of normal in size. There is vascular engorgement,
 perihilar haziness and a diffuse reticular pattern, particularly in the mid
 and lower lung zones. Again demonstrated is a moderate sized loculated left
 pleural effusion, which is not significantly changed in the interval. There
 remains an unusual contour of the right hemidiaphragm, which is likely due to
 a subpulmonic right pleural effusion.

 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and there is vascular engorgement,
 perihilar haziness, and a reticular pattern in the mid and lower lung zones. A
 confluent opacity is noted at the right lung base adjacent to the right
 effusion and appears slightly more prominent compared to the prior exam.

 IMPRESSION: 1) Moderate sized laterally loculated left pleural effusion.
 Probable right subpulmonic pleural effusion. These findings are not
 significantly changed compared to the previous study.

 2) Congestive heart failure with interstitial pulmonary edema.

 3) More confluent opacity at right lung base, which may be due to asymmetric
 congestive heart failure, but underlying infection is not fully excluded in
 this region.

 CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.

 INDICATION:  Distant breath sounds, evaluate for possible pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view obtained on immediate postoperative patient in
 supine position demonstrates status post sternotomy and the presence of
 multiple surgical clips in the left mediastinum is suggestive of previous
 bypass surgery.  The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea
 some 5 cm above the carina.  NG tube has been placed and seen to reach below
 the diaphragm, curling up in the fundus.  The right jugular approach central
 venous line carries a Swan-Ganz catheter, the tip of which reaches the main
 PA.  On the left side there is one mediastinal drainage tube placed.  Both
 lungs are well expanded without evidence of pneumothorax and no signs of
 significant pulmonary vascular congestion.  The lateral pleural sinuses are

 infiltrates.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The right central venous
 catheter is unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Mild CHF.
 2. Interval increase in the interstitial infiltrates. This could represent
 cardiac failure and pulmonary edema vs. a transplant reaction.  Follow up is

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**6-2**] COMPARED TO [**5-29**].

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Persistent fever.  Multiple myeloma.

 A vascular catheter remains in satisfactory position.  Cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  There is vascular engorgement and diffuse perihilar
 haziness.  Bilateral pleural opacities are again demonstrated and are probably
 unchanged allowing for the degree of rotation of the patient although the
 lower right pleural opacity is less well visualized on the current study than
 on the prior study.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle was
 noted suggestive of small effusion.  Skeletal structures demonstrate a healed
 lower left rib fracture.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Worsening perihilar haziness.  In the setting of vascular engorgement,
 this is probably due to fluid overload.  Atypical infection is considered less
 likely, but is not excluded.
 2.  Bilateral pleural lesions, which have been better demonstrated on CT scan.

 HISTORY:  67 year old man with persistent fevers and elevated white blood cell
 count. Patient with a history of small bowel obstruction status post
 resection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
 obtained following the administration of oral contrast and 150 cc of Optiray.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient has a tracheostomy tube
 present.  There is a nasojejunal feeding tube, with its tip in the distal
 jejunum.

 There are large bilateral pleural effusions, which have increased in the
 interval.  In addition, there is extensive consolidation of the right middle,
 right lower and left lower lobes.  Small consolidations are seen in the upper
 lobes bilaterally, as well.

 There are prevascular lymph nodes seen on series 3, image 16 measuring 1.5 x
 0.8 cm.  There is a precarinal lymph node measuring 1.2 x 1.6 cm.  There are
 smaller precarinal lymph nodes measuring up to 11 x 9 mm. There is a small
 calcified granuloma seen on series 3, image 17 measuring less than 3 mm in
 size.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are gallstones seen in the
 gallbladder, unchanged.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
 kidneys are unremarkable.  Please note that full evaluation of the
 intraabdominal organs is slightly limited secondary to the lack of IV contrast
 used.  There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.  No fluid
 collections or hematomas are identified.  There is a midline abdominal wall
 defect, as well as numerous surgical clips in the abdominal wall, reflective
 of the patient's recent surgery.

 There are a few loops of small bowel which appear slightly thickened, however,
 this appearance could also be secondary to non-distention.  There is no
 obstruction identified.  The large bowel loops are unremarkable.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter in the
 bladder.  The rectosigmoid colon is unremarkable.  There is no free air or
 free fluid in the pelvis.

 HISTORY: 62-year-old man with status post pseudomonas sepsis, needs IV
 antibiotics. IV team unable to place PICC at bedside. Patient is here today
 for placement of a double-lumen PICC line.

 RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2243**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 629**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 884**] attending radiologist
 present and supervised throughout the procedure.

 PROCEDURE: The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion. As no suitable superficial veins were visualized ultrasound was used
 for localization of a suitable vein. The right basilic vein was patent and
 compressible. Under ultrasonographic guidance through an anesthetized skin
 approach access was gained into the right basilic vein with a 21 gauge single-
 wall puncture needle. A .018 guidewire was then advanced into the superior
 vena cava. Based on the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a
 length of 34 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and
 advanced over a 5 Fr introducer sheath into the superior vena cava. The sheath
 was removed. The catheter was flushed. A final chest x-ray was obtained
 demonstrating the tip of the catheter in the superior vena cava. The line is
 ready for immediate use.

 StatLock was applied and the line was heplocked.

 COMPLICATIONS: None.

 ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 5 Fr 34 cm long double-lumen PICC line via
 right basilic vein, tip in the superior vena cava. The line is ready for use.

 CHEST PORTABLE AP:

 INDICATION:  Status post right decortication.  Now status post Dobhoff tube
 placement.  Sepsis.  Rule out pneumonia and check tracheostomy placement.

 FINDINGS:  A single high contrast supine chest image is provided.  Comparison
 study dated [**2140-2-24**].  There is evidence of surgical fractures and ressections
 of the right 5th, 6th and 7th, presumably related to the cortication
 procedure.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is noted,
 consistent with a small effusion.  There is also evidence of a small effusion
 on the left side, associated with some minor patchy atelectasis at the left
 lung base, with elevation of the left diaphragm.  Some atelectatic changes are
 noted in the basal segments of both lower lobes.  Otherwise the lungs appear
 clear.  The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement.  The pulmonary
 vessels do not indicate significant cardiac failure at this time.  The
 tracheostomy tube appears satisfactorily positioned.  A left subclavian
 central line is noted with its tip just below the SVC right atrial junction.
 An NG line is noted with its tip in the mid portion of the stomach.

 Compared to the prior examination of [**2-24**] the appearances of the heart, lungs
 and pleura appear stable and not significantly changed.

 IMPRESSION:   Post operative changes remain stable.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are noted.  Lines appear in reasonably
 satisfactory position.

 INDICATION:  New central line, abdominal pain, sepsis and ARDS.

 AP chest dated [**2147-5-5**] is compared with AP radiograph dated [**2147-5-2**]:  The ET tube has been removed.  There is a new tracheostomy tube with
 the tip in the mid trachea.  There is a new left subclavian central venous
 catheter with the tip overlying the mid SVC.  The right subclavian central
 venous catheter tip overlies the distal SVC.  There is a nasojejunal tube.
 Again demonstrated are diffuse bilateral air-space and reticulonodular
 densities.  There is a suggestion of increased lucency at the right lung base.
  This may be due to a basilar pneumothorax.  There are no pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:  The lucency at the right lung base may indicate a basilar
 pneumothorax.  A repeat chest x-ray is recommended for further evaluation.
 There has been no change in the appearance of the lungs for which the
 differential includes ARDS, infection and pulmonary edema.  The left

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2142-4-29**] @ 9:32.

 INDICATION:CABG with line changes.

 COMPARISON:  [**2142-4-27**] @14:39.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, patient has been extubated, SG catheter has
 been removed and replaced with an introducer sheath, the latter overlying the
 right IJ region and the left chest tube remains in place.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Shallow inspiration limits the evaluation, but there is no
 definite evidence of new infiltrate.  Subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis is
 noted.

 IMPRESSION:  No ptx following line changes. The right IJ line, might be more
 proximally located then intended - this is not in SVC.

 INDICATION:  NG tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  [**2140-2-21**] at 5:13.

 FINDINGS:  An NG tube is seen coursing below the level of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Since the left hemidiaphragm is obscured due to atelectasis or
 pneumonia, I cannot be certain of the level of the NG tube, though I suspect
 that it is in the stomach.  Consider obtaining dedicated view of lower chest
 and upper abdomen for further assessment.  The three right sided chest tubes
 and right CVL remain in place.  On the current projection, the ET tube is not
 well seen.  There are no new infiltrates compared to prior study and the
 pulmonary vascular markings are stable.

 AP supine single view of the chest is compared to a similar view from the same
 day ten hours earlier.

 FINDINGS:  There is interval placement of a left subclavian central line with
 the tip lying horizontally in the superior SVC.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.

 In the interval there is slight improvement in the diffuse bilateral alveolar
 opacities.  This is most likely improvement of pulmonary edema (CHF versus
 ARDS).  The fact that there is improvement in such a short interval suggests
 at least some CHF component.  Remaining lines and tubes are unchanged in
 position.  Interval improved lung volumes.

 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, sepsis, ARDS.  Follow up CHF.

 Please note that this is an old unreported chest radiograph.

 A portable supine chest radiograph shows a Swan-Ganz catheter placed from the
 right internal jugular vein via sheath and a nasogastric tube.  These appear
 in good position. An endotracheal tube is seen with the tip slightly high,
 6-1/2 to 7 cm above the carina, just beyond the thoracic inlet.  This could be
 advanced 2 cm.  The lungs show maintained volumes, but with widespread, patchy
 alveolar consolidation with some air bronchograms and obscuration of the
 contour of the right hemidiaphragm from some combination of consolidation and
 perhaps fluid. The central pulmonary vasculature is not well seen through the
 density. The appearance is most suggestive of ARDS and some associated edema
 or pneumonia may be present.

 CONCLUSION:
 1.  ARDS.
 2.  High location of endotracheal tube.

 An ETT remains in place, currently terminating approximately 6 1/2 cm above
 the carina. A right internal jugular vascular catheter, 2 right sided chest
 tubes and an NG tube remain in place in satisfactory position. Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. Vascular engorgement and
 perihilar haziness is again demonstrated as well as bilateral pleural
 effusions, with the left likely partially loculated in the mid and lower lung
 zone peripherally. Note is also made of increased opacity within the left
 retrocardiac region. As compared to the recent study of 1 day earlier, the
 left retrocardiac opacity is worse in the interval. Finally, note is made of
 fullness of both hilar regions with a rounded appearance. Prior CTA of [**2-9**], [**2139**] reported evidence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy which may account
 for this finding.

 CLINICAL INDICATION: Confusion; requiring increased oxygen.

 COMPARISON: No films available.

 CHEST, PORTABLE:

 FINDINGS: There are bilateral effusions visualized and increased reticular
 markings in the upper lobes right greater than left, both medially
 predominant.  In addition, there is increased prominence of lower lobe
 interstitial markings with associated small nodular features as well.
 Comparision with prior films would be most useful.  Cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Some segmental
 atelectasis is visualized at the left base but no dense consolidation is seen.
 The pulmonary vascular markings do not appear substantially distended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  61 year old female with chronic TPN requirement.  Patient requests
 single-lumen PICC line for TPN.

 PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 35056**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 22981**]
 [**Name (STitle) 29638**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29638**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising the
 entire procedure.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the
 standard sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial vein was visible,
 ultrasound was used for localization of an appropriate vein.  The right
 basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After anesthesia with 4 cc of 1%
 lidocaine, the right basilic vein was entered under ultrasound guidance with a
 21-gauge micropuncture needle.  Hard copies were obtained before and after
 establishing an access.  A 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the access
 needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic visualization. The skin
 entry site was incised with a #11 blade scalpel.  The access needle was
 exchanged over the guide wire for a 4-French micropuncture sheath with inner
 dilator.  Based on the markers on the guide wire, it was determined that a
 length of 41 cm would be appropriate.  The inner dilator was removed.  The
 catheter was advanced through the peel-away sheath over the guide wire until
 the tip was present in the superior vena cava.  The guide wire was removed.
 The peel-away sheath was removed.  The line was flushed and capped.

 FINDINGS:  A final AP chest x-ray was obtained, demonstrating the tip of the
 catheter to be present in the superior vena cava just above the right atrium.
 The line was heplocked and is ready for immediate use.

 COMPLICATIONS:  None.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 41-cm 4-French single-lumen PICC line
 via the right basilic vein.  The tip of the catheter is in the superior vena
 cava.  The line is ready for use.

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2161-7-19**] AT 12:46 A.M.:

 INDICATION:  Assess ETT position.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior examination from one day earlier, an ETT has been
 placed, with the tip at the level of the clavicles.  Right internal jugular
 line and NGT are unchanged, and in satisfactory position.  There remain
 bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is at the upper limits of normal.  The heart size is grossly
 within normal limits.  Retrocardiac opacification is noted, possibly related
 to the patient's effusion, and/or atelectasis/consolidation.  Overall, given
 differences in positioning since the prior day, there has been no significant
 interval change.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Satisfactory position of ETT.
 2)  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, overall not
 significantly changed allowing for differences in positioning.

 HISTORY:  S/P renal transplant.  Complaining of facial swelling and shortness
 of breath.  Evaluate for SVC occlusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  MR angiography of the chest was performed utilizing the following
 sequences:  Axial 2D TOF images, coronal true FISP images, axial DB HASTE
 images, ECG gaited axial T1W turbo FLASH images, and coronal VIBE images prior
 to and following the IV administration of Gadolinium.  Three dimensional
 reconstructions were generated on an image processing workstation.  No prior
 studies are available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:
 MR CHEST W/CONTRAST:  Following the IV administration of contrast material
 intraluminal filling defect is seen within the superior vena cava, bilateral
 brachiocephalic veins, and central internal jugular veins, representing
 thrombus.  No significant collateral venous drainage is identified.  The
 patient's right internal jugular perm-cath is not well seen.

 Two dimensional TOF axial images through the neck demonstrate normal direction
 of flow within both vertebral arteries.  The left vertebral artery is
 dominant.  The visualized portions of the carotid arteries are normal.

 There is a left-sided aortic arch which demonstrates a normal branching
 pattern of the great vesels.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and
 contour without luminal irregularity, focal stenosis, or aneurysmal
 dilatation.  No pericardial effusion is present.  The heart is at the upper
 limits of normal in size.

 Limited images of the lungs demonstrate consolidation involving the left lower
 lobe, most likely representing pneumonia.

 Review of reconstructed images was essential in confirming the above findings.

 IMPRESSION:

 Intraluminal thrombus involving the superior vena cava, bilateral
 brachiocephalic veins, and central bilateral internal jugular veins.

 Left lower lobe consolidation most consistent with pneumonia.  Follow up to
 resolution with chest radiographs is recommended.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post AAA repair, now with decreased oxygen saturations.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to an exam of [**2119-10-12**].  The tip of a right-sided
 central venous catheter overlies the expected region of the SVC.  A
 nasogastric tube is inappropriate position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

 There are markedly low lung volumes.  Allowing for this limitation, the heart
 size and mediastinal/hilar contours are likely stable.  There is linear
 opacifications of both lung bases, with no definite evidence of focal
 consolidations.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  The visualized
 soft tissues and osseous structures are stable.

 IMPRESSION:  Limited assessment secondary to markedly low lung volumes.
 Increased linear opacifications of both lung bases likely represent bibasilar
 atelectasis.  An early infectious process, however, cannot be excluded on the
 present exam.

 PORTABLE CHEST:

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.

 An endotracheal tube is present in a relatively proximal position above the
 level of thoracic inlet, terminating about 6.5 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the distal stomach.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for patient rotation.
 There is worsening left cardiac opacity and there is also new blunting of the
 left costophrenic sulcus.  The right lung appears grossly clear except for
 mild perihilar haziness.

 IMPRESSION:

 1)  Proximal location of endotracheal tube terminating above the thoracic
 inlet level.
 2)  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity, possibly due to a combination of
 atelectasis and effusion.  Underlying infection in the left lower lobe should
 also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 3)  Probable mild perihilar edema.

 INDICATION:  42 year old woman status post kidney transplant ten days ago with
 an elevated creatinine.  She has a hematocrit drop and had an SVC stenting
 yesterday.  Evaluate for acute bleeding.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the lung apices
 through the pubic symphysis.  No oral or intravenous contrast was
 administered.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is diffuse anasarca of the
 subcutaneous tissues.  There is no para-aortic or mediastinal hematoma.  There
 is a trace pericardial effusion and a small left pleural effusion.  There is
 no right pleural effusion.  There are a few coarse coronary artery
 calcifications.  There is collapse of the posterior wall of the upper airway.
 This is consistent with tracheomalacia.  There is resulting air trapping seen
 on lung windows.  Additionally on lung windows there is consolidation with air
 bronchograms in the left lower lobe most likely representing a pneumonia and
 less likely atelectasis.  The patient has a nasogastric tube.  A stent is seen
 in the right subclavian vein and upper SVC.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The noncontrast images of the liver,
 spleen, pancreas and adrenals are within normal limits.  The kidneys are
 atrophic.  The gallbladder is mildly distended with surrounding
 pericholecystic fluid.  A nasogastric tip is in the antrum of the stomach. The
 upper bowel loops are unremarkable.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is an abdominal incision overlying
 the right lower quadrant with underlying irregular soft tissue density
 presumably a postoperative seroma.  There is no gas within this collection to
 suggest an abscess.  The renal transplant is seen in the right lower quadrant.
 This is excreting contrast presumably received from the angiographic study.
 There is a small simple cyst of the upper pole of the transplant kidney.  Just
 medial to the transplant kidney there is a multifocal fluid collection.  Given
 the patient is recently postop this may represent a postoperative seroma,
 hematoma or an abscess.  There are no particular gas bubbles within this
 collection to differentiate the above etiology.  There is a tiny air bubble
 just next to the lower pole of the transplant kidney.  This is not

 definitively within one of these areas of fluid.  Contrast from the
 transplanted kidney can be seen being excreted into the urinary bladder. There
 are dense calcifications of the uterine fibroid.  Again there is anasarca of
 the subcutaneous tissues.  There is no pelvic free fluid.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of acute hematoma throughout the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
 2.  Tracheomalacia with associated air trapping in the lungs.  Once the
 patient is extubated and clinically stable, a CT of the trachea is suggested.
 3.  Consolidation with air bronchograms in the left lower lung zone most
 likely pneumonia.
 4.  Small left pleural effusion.
 5.  Small focal area of fluid medial to the transplant kidney in the right
 lower quadrant.  This does not have specific imaging features and may
 represent a postoperative seroma, hematoma or an abscess.
 6.  Irregular fluid deep to the incision in the right lower quadrant most
 likely a postoperative seroma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen
 and pelvis were obtained without IV contrast.

 COMPARISON:  [**2108-9-18**].

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The heart is normal in size.  The vessels
 are normal in caliber.  There is a right subclavian stent extending into the
 proximal SVC.  Ther also appears to be a left subclavian line. There is no
 evidence for mediastinal heomatoma or lymphadenopathy. There is an opacity
 with air bronchogram in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. Left
 pleural effusion and left basilar infiltrate have resolved. Nasogastric and
 endotracheal tubes are in stable positions.  Again, there is collapse of the
 posterior wall of the trachea, consistent with tracheomalacia.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:  There is diffuse subcutaneous edema
 consistent with anasarca. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
 glands are unremarkalbe. The native kidneys are atrophic.  The small and large
 bowel are normal in caliber. There is no evidence for intra-abdominal
 hematoma.

 Beneath the surgical staples in the right lower quadrant, the previously
 identified fluid collections - seroma remains stable in configuration and
 size.  It has increased in density.

 CT OF THE PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:  The transplant kidney located in the right
 lower quadrant demonstrates a dense nephrogram. There is contrast material
 within the right pelvis.  There is mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter
 extending into the bladder.  There is no evidence for peritransplant hematoma
 or seroma. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.  The bladder is decompressed
 by a balloon Foley catheter.  There are enlarged calcified and noncalcified
 fibroids.  There is no free fluid within the pelvis.

 HISTORY:  Status post MI and stent.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  The heart is upper limits of normal in size.  The aortic
 knob is calcified and there is some prominence of the main and left pulmonary
 artery contours.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
 bilateral interstitial opacity, which is asymmetric-- more pronounced in the
 right upper lobe.  Additionally, there is left lower lobe atelectasis.  Marked
 degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with asymmetric pulmonary edema, although a
 superimposed infectious process or aspiration in the right upper lobe is not
 excluded.  Continued followup radiographs are recommended.

 FINDINGS:  Portable chest from 07:08 a.m. is compared to the study obtained 1
 hour earlier.  Endotracheal tube has been placed.   The tip is at the thoracic
 inlet and could be advanced.  NG tube has been advanced into the stomach.  The
 right-sided chest tube has pulled back slightly, and the side port is now
 positioned just at the lateral right thoracic wall.  The residual pneumothorax
 seen earlier is less evident.  There is still a small area of lucency
 medially, which probably represents residual anterior pneumothorax that has
 not yet evacuated.

 Expansion of the lungs has improved.  There is still diffuse hazy opacity seen
 throughout both lungs, although overall aeration of the lungs has improved.

 IMPRESSION:

 1)  ET tube at the thoracic inlet.

 2)  Persistent small residual anterior pneumothorax.

 3)  Overall improved aeration.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies.

 CHEST, AP SUPINE VIEW:  Evaluation is limited by the overlying trauma board
 structures.  The endotracheal tube terminates in satisfactory position, just
 below the thoracic inlet.  The lateral left margin of the aortic knob is
 suboptimally evaluated secondary to an overlying beam.  The remainder of the
 aortic contour is unremarkable.  The cardiac contour is unremarkable.  There
 is no parenchymal consolidation.  There is mild prominence of the suprahilar
 lung markings bilaterally, which may be due to technique. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The trachea is midline. No fractures are
 identified.

 PELVIS, AP SUPINE VIEW:  Evaluation is limited by the superimposed trauma
 board structures.  The superior portions of the iliac crests are not included
 on the image.  No fractures are identified on this single projection.  The
 sacroiliac joints and the pubic symphysis are not widened.  Degenerative
 changes are noted in both hips, more prominent on the left.  The visualized
 soft tissues appear unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION: 1. Suboptimal evaluation of the left lateral contour of the aortic

 earlier.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  S/P esophagogastrectomy and gastric pull through.

 Bilateral chest tubes remain in place.  A previously noted right apical
 pneumothorax appears slightly larger in the interval.  A left apical
 pneumothorax is not definitively seen on the prior studies.  A nasogastric
 tube remains in place.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with post-
 operative changes noted related to gastric pull up procedure.  There is
 persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely improved in the interval.  Small
 pleural effusions are noted. There is a large amount of free air within the
 abdomen, presumably post-operative.

 IMPRESSION:  1)  Small bilateral pneumothoraces.  The right has slightly
 increased in the interval and the left is apparently new.  Bilateral chest
 tubes remain in place.

 2)  Free interperitoneal air, which may be due to recent abdominal surgery.
 However, the amount of air appears more prominent than on the earlier study.
 Clinical correlation suggested to exclude the possibility of perforation, as
 discussed with the clinical service caring for the patient.

 SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, with
 left ventricular predominance.  The aorta is unfolded with mural
 calcifications.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  A
 tracheostomy tube is seen barely penetrating the trachea.

 When compared with the prior study dated [**2135-12-24**], there has been mild
 improvement in the right lung aeration, and mild improvement in size of the
 cardiac silhouette and the size of the left-sided pleural effusion.  There is
 persistent opacification of the left lung, most likely corresponding with a
 layering pleural effusion on this side.  A drain is overlying the area of the
 stomach, possibly representing a gastrostomy tube.

 IMPRESSION:

 1).  Overall interval improvement in cardiopulmonary status with improved
 aeration of the right lung.  Persistent layering pleural effusion on the left,
 also somewhat decreased in the interval.

 2).  Tracheostomy tube is seen barely penetrating the trachea.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: 74 year old with intracranial hemorrhage and poor venous access.

 PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 84460**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 30992**] with Dr.
 [**First Name (STitle) **], the attending radiologist, being present for and supervising the
 procedure. The right upper arm was prepped in sterile fashion. Since no
 suitbable superficial vein was visible, ultrasound was used for localization
 of a suitable vein. The basilic vein was patent and compressible. After local
 anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under
 ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. Procedure was slightly
 technically challenging due to patient cooperation. An .018 guide wire was
 advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava. Based on the markers
 of the guide wire, it was determined that a length of 33 cm would be
 appropriate. The catheter was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 Fr
 introducer sheath into the superior vena cava. The sheath was then removed and
 the catheter flushed. A final chest x-ray was obtained documenting position of
 the catheter tip in the mid-SVC. A StatLock was applied, and the line was
 heplocked. The line is ready for use.

 During the procedure, the patient became hypertensive with systolic blood
 pressures of 190. 10 mg of IV hydralazine was given during the procedure.

 IMPRESSION:
 Successful placement of a 33 cm single-lumen PICC via the right basilic vein
 with its tip in the mid-SVC. The line is ready for use.

 FINDINGS:  The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is
 calcification within the aortic arch.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, focal infiltrate, or pneumothorax.  There is
 slight increased density within the right paratracheal region, which may
 represent superimposition of shadows.  The osseous structures are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Vague increased density in the right paratracheal region.
 Although this may relate to overlapping shadows, a chest CT is recommended for
 confirmation.

 INDICATION:  An 83-year-old woman status post coronary artery bypass graft,
 with coronary artery disease.

 A single AP view of the chest dated [**2196-3-15**] is compared with the same
 examination from the prior day.  The left chest tube is in a somewhat
 different position.  Otherwise, there has been no change in position of the
 mediastinal drains, bilateral internal jugular venous sheaths, endotracheal
 and NG tubes.  There has been interval development of plate-like atelectasis
 in the left mid-lung.  Additionally within the right mid-lung field, there is
 partial atelectasis.  There is diffuse haziness of the bilateral lung bases,
 right greater than left, which is consistent with bilateral layering pleural
 effusions in this supine patient.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
 There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Status post CABG surgery with tubes and lines as described above.
 Slight change in position of the left-sided chest tube.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Bilateral atelectatic changes in
 the mid-lung zones.  No overt CHF.

 Portable supine chest, 6:03 a.m., [**2163-2-17**].

 Since the study from 3 hours earlier, a right-sided chest tube has been
 placed.  There is still a small residual anterior pneumothorax, which projects
 as a lucency over the mid right lung.  Worsening aeration of both lungs is
 present.  Bibasilar opacities are probably atelectasis and diffuse bilateral
 lung opacity is likely related to hyaline membrane disease.

 A nasogastric tube has been placed.  The tip just reaches the stomach.

 or pulmonary edema.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the patient in
 supine position and is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral preoperative chest examination.  The patient is now status post
 sternotomy and intubated.  The ET tube terminates in the trachea some 4 cm
 above the level of the carina.  An NG tube has been passed reaching far below
 the diaphragm.  A right internal jugular vein sheath carries the Swan-Ganz
 catheter is seen to terminate in the pulmonary main stem where the tip makes a
 reverse loop.  Two mediastinal drainage tubes advance from below and a left-
 sided chest tube are seen, the latter terminating in the lateral superior area
 of the pleural space without evidence of pneumothorax.  There is only a mild
 degree of postoperative superior mediastinal widening and the heart size had
 not increased.  No new parenchymal infiltrates can be identified but
 comparison with the previous preoperative chest examination demonstrates more
 marked perivascular haze throughout the lung fields.  This could be related to
 the administration of Crystaloid fluid not necessarily representing CHF.

 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory findings on first postoperative chest examination in
 patient with chest findings suggestive of background COPD.

 INDICATION:  Fall, trauma.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed using the
 trauma protocol.  150 cc of Optiray non-ionic contrast was used for this
 examination.  Non-ionic contrast was used given the rapid bolus required for
 CTA as well as the recent trauma just sustained.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest performed [**2117-12-22**]

 FINDINGS:

 CTA:  There is no evidence of aortic injury, mediastinal hemorrhage, or
 pulmonary embolism.  A somewhat redundant appearance of the thoracic aorta is
 seen, which is consistent with prior aneurysm repair.  In addition, the
 abdominal aorta is aneurysmal in the suprarenal region.  It measures up to 4.7
 x 5.4 cm, with areas of mild mural thrombosis.  In addition, the aortic arch
 measures up to 5 cm in diameter on the current examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  There is dependent bibasilar opacity, predominantly relating
 to atelectasis.  Mild changes of paraseptal emphysema are also seen.

 There are several sub-cm low density foci within the right posterior lobe of
 the liver, too small to characterize.  There is no evidence of hepatic
 laceration.  The gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, and small bowel
 are unremarkable aside from a small to moderate hiatal hernia.  There is a 1.7
 cm low density focus along the anterior aspect of the pancreatic head.  While
 the right kidney enhances, it is extremely atrophic relative to the left.
 Multiple low density foci are seen within the left kidney, although in general
 these are too small to accurately characterize.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The large bowel, bladder, and visualized
 portions of the distal ureters are unremarkable.  Multiple surgical clips are
 seen along the aorta, relating to prior aortic surgery.  There is no
 significant pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  The prostate is enlarged.
 There is an intramuscular lipoma at the left buttocks.

 Examination of osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
  There is degenerative narrowing at the L4-5 and L5-S1 disk spaces, without
 other significant abnormalities.

 Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were also reviewed, which did not
 demonstrate significant abnormalities.  In addition, obliquely reformatted MIP
 images of the aorta were also obtained for further characterization of the
 ectatic thoracic aorta.  This has a redundant appearance, consistent with
 post-surgical change.  In the coronally reformatted images, the abdominal
 aorta at the level of the renal arteries measures up to 4.9 cm in size.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  No evidence of post-traumatic vascular injury.
 2)  Post-operative appearance of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, with
 aneurysmal dilation of both the aortic arch as well as the suprarenal aorta up
 to 5 cm in diameter.
 3)  No evidence of post-traumatic visceral injury.
 4)  Atrophy of the right kidney.
 5)  Small focal illdefined low density cystic appearing region along the
 anterior aspect of the pancreatic head without associated ductal dilatation of
 main pancreatic or biliary ducts. Further evaluation could be performed by
 MRCP if clinically warranted, or stability can be assessed on routine followup
 CT for aneurysm stability, as planned.
 6)  Multiple low density lesions within the left kidney are too small to
 accurately characterize.  If the patient undergoes MRCP, this could be imaged
 in the same setting if specifically requested.

 bleeding at the site related to dissection in this patient with an elevated
 INR (1.6) and low platelets (25 K). This was controlled by manual pressure.
 The catheter was then removed and pressure was applied to the right neck until
 hemostasis was achieved. The tunnel access site was closed with SteriStrips
 and covered with gauge and a Tegaderm. The tip was sent for culture.

 IMPRESSION: Successful removal of a tunneled triple-lumen catheter. Tip sent
 for culture.

 INDICATION:  History of right pleurodesis with continued dyspnea and chest
 pain.

 COMPARISON:  [**2140-4-20**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 lung apices to the lung bases before and after the administration of 100 cc of
 IV opacification.  Nonionic contrast was administered secondary to the rapid
 bolus requirement needed per protocol.  Multiplanar reconstructions were
 performed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arterial
 vasculature is well visualized down to the segmental branches.  No filling
 defects are identified.  Mural calcifications are again noted within the
 thoracic aorta.  Coronary artery calcifications are also present.  The heart,
 pericardium and great vessels are otherwise within normal limits.  No pleural
 effusions ae identified.  Again seen are multiple enlarged lymph nodes within
 the prevascular, pretracheal, and subcarinal regions, stable in appearance
 from the prior study.  No significant axillary or hilar lymph adenopathy is
 present.  Multiple subcentimeter lymph nodes are again identified within both
 supraclavicular regions, unchanged from the prior study.  Again seen is mild
 thickening of the right pleura which is consistent with the patient's history
 of decortication.

 Lung window images reveal consolidation within the right lower lobe with air
 bronchograms present, findings consistent with pneumonia.  The appearance of
 this consolidation appears relatively stable since the prior study.
 Additionally, atelectasis is noted within the left lower lobe.  No pulmonary
 nodules are identified.  The airways are patent to the level of the segmental
 bronchi bilaterally.

 In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the visualized spleen, liver, and
 stomach appear within normal limits.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Again identified are fractures through the right 6th, 7th and
 8th ribs.

 COMPARISON:  [**2147-5-10**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
 upper abdomen.

 CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The tracheostomy tube remains in
 satisfactory position.  The feeding tube courses into the stomach, the distal
 tip is not visualized.  There has been slight interval decrease in size of the
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There are persistent moderate-sized bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The heart is slightly
 enlarged.  Coronary calcifications are noted.  Multiple small mediastinal
 lymph nodes are present which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic
 enlargement.  The appearance is unchanged compared with the prior study.
 There is no significant hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.

 In the interval compared with the prior study, there has been improvement in
 aeration of the lungs with decreased consolidation within the left lower lobe.
  There is persistent diffuse ground glass opacification and small areas of
 consolidation within the dependent portions of the lungs.

 There are gallstones.  There is a small amount of free fluid within the
 abdomen adjacent to the pancreatic tail.  There is diffuse stranding of the
 mesentery.  A small amount of subcutaneous air is present within the anterior
 abdominal wall likely due to recent surgery, as surgical clips overlie the mid
 abdomen.  Note, this chest CT does not fully evaluate the abdomen.

 There are no suspicious osseous lesions.

 ARDS, but an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  The appearance
 of the lung parenchyma is somewhat improved compared with the prior study with
 decrease in the degree of consolidation.  Persistent diffuse ground glass
 opacification and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

 INDICATION:  Allogenic bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma with A-
 fib, interstitial infiltrate versus pulmonary edema.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 emboli, also with pancreatitis, please evaluate.

 COMPARISONS:  [**2147-6-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helically-acquired axial images were obtained through
 the chest prior to and following the administration of 100 cc of intravenous
 opacification in the pulmonary arterial phase.  Additional delayed images and
 non-contrast images were obtained through the upper abdomen. Multiplanar
 reformatted images were performed.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is suboptimal
 opacification of the pulmonary arteries due to limited bolus opacification,
 however, allowing for this no central or sizeable pulmonary emboli are
 visualized. Cardiomegaly, unchanged.  The airways are patent to the level of
 the subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.  Nodular pleural thickening is again
 appreciated, not significantly changed in the interval.

 There is interval development of bibasilar centrilobular nodular densities,
 with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2319**] appearance, and of patchy multifocal pulmonary consolidation
 involving the right upper lobe, left upper lobe, right middle lobe, and

 HISTORY:  67 year old gentleman with acute renal failure requiring long-term
 dialysis access.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 78**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 551**]
 who was present and supervising throughout.  The patient's left neck and upper
 chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  After infusion of
 1% lidocaine, the left internal jugular vein was accessed under
 ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle. Hard copies of ultrasound
 images were obtained before and after establishing an access. A 0.018 wire was
 advanced into the SVC using fluoroscopic guidance. The puncture needle was
 exchanged for a 4- French catheter. Using the wire for measurement, it was
 determined that a catheter of 27 cm cuff to tip would be appropriate for use.
 A catheter was obtained and bathed in orthopedic solution.  Next, 1% lidocaine
 was infused along the designated tunnel tract from the patient's left upper
 chest to left IJ puncture site.  A small incision was made with an 11-blade
 scalpel. The catheter was then attached to the tunneling device and advanced
 from the left upper chest incision to the left IJ puncture site.  The 0.018
 wire and inner dilator of the 4-French catheter were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16**] wire
 was advanced into the SVC using fluoroscopic guidance.
  The tract was then progressively dilated with 10- and 12-French dilators.  A
 14.5-French peel-away sheath was then advanced over the wire.  The inner
 dilator and wire were then removed and the dialysis catheter was advanced
 through the sheath using fluoroscopic guidance.  The sheath was peeled away.
 The catheter tip was positioned in the right atrium and the cuff was
 positioned just adjacent to the skin exit site.  The neck puncture site was
 then closed with 3-0 Prolene suture and the catheter was also secured with 3-0
 Prolene sutures. The line was then flushed and heplocked.  Final chest image
 demonstrated appropriated positioning of the line tip at the right atrium. The
 patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
 procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 27-cm cuff-to-tip 14.5-French tunneled
 hemodialysis catheter via left IJ access with tip in right atrium.  The line
 is ready for use.

 Seven radiographs of the bilateral ribs demonstrate a right-sided central
 venous catheter with its tip in the superior vena cava. Multiple bilateral
 pleural-based opacities are again noted and better characterized on the recent
 CT examination of the chest dated [**2147-6-5**]. The lung parenchyma and the
 previously described right middle lobe atelectasis are not well evaluated on
 this study which was tailored for evaluation of the ribs.

 There are fractures of the left lateral 6th and 9th ribs which demonstrate
 callus formation, again better seen on recent CT exam. Fracture of the right
 lateral 6th rib is demonstrated on the study of [**2147-6-5**], but was not
 present on the CT exam of [**2147-5-30**].

 Numerous osseous lesions involving the vertebral bodies and ribs are again
 better evaluated on recent CT exam.

 IMPRESSION: Left lateral 6th and 9th ribs and right lateral 6th rib fractures
 with callus formation. Pulmonary disease including right middle lobe
 atelectasis and numerous osseous mets are better characterized on recent CT
 examination.

 PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison is made to [**6-21**] and [**2147-6-29**].

 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube terminating several
 centimeters above the carina and in satisfactory position.  Other tubes and
 lines are unchanged in position.  There is slight improvement in patchy
 opacification at the right lung base.  However, there is increasing
 opacification in the left retrocardiac region with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm as well as increased prominence of opacity in the right upper
 lobe.  A left pleural prominence is seen peripherally which may represent
 locualted effusion.  ... ? Lateral or bilateral .... basilar effusions appear
 largely unchanged.

 HISTORY:  Full-term male with grunting.  History of maternal GBS positive.
 Adequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

 FINDINGS:  This is the first chest radiograph on this patient.  The lung
 volumes are low.  Streaky and patchy opacities are seen throughout most of the
 left lung.  Only a very small amount of left lung is aerated in the apex and
 region of the costophrenic sulcus.  There may be a small left pleural
 effusion.  There is complete opacification seen in the right upper lobe, and
 streaky opacities are seen in the right mid lung and right lower lobe.  The
 heart and mediastinum contours are grossly within normal limits.  The patient
 is rotated.  The stomach is gas filled.

 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lung opacities (left greater) in this full term
 infant may represent transient tachypnea of the newborn or neonatal
 pneumonia, with superimposed multifocal atelectasis. Clinical correlation is
 required.

 COMPARISON:  Previous study of earlier the same date.

 INDICATION:  IJ line placement.

 A right internal jugular vascular catheter is currently in satisfactory
 position within the superior vena cava.  The line appears more proximal than
 on the earlier study of the same date, and may have been repositioned or
 replaced in the interval.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 previously identified left PICC line is no longer evident, and by report has
 been removed in the interval. Apparent fullness in right paratracheal region
 is likely due to rotation, but attention to this region on a repeat,
 nonrotated CXR may be helpful to fully exclude hematoma, as discussed with Dr.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This newborn preterm infant is on day of life #1 and is
 having various lines placed.

 FINDINGS:  A single portable view of the chest and abdomen was obtained and is
 compared to the previous film dated [**2180-6-29**] at 19:39.

 An ET tube is in place with its tip midway between the thoracic inlet and
 carina.  The UV catheter tip is in the right atrium.  The UA catheter tip
 overlies the left pedicle of the T9 vertebral body.

 The heart size and pulmonary vascularity are within the range of normal
 limits.  There is a ground-glass opacification of the lungs suggesting the
 diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease.  The bowel gas pattern and visualized
 bony structures are normal.

 placement.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest films since [**2102-8-16**], most
 recently earlier on [**8-28**] at 09:24.

 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has progressed.  This either obscures a
 right lower lobe pneumonia or reflects more widespread distribution of was
 asymmetric edema in that location.  ET tube is in standard placement. Heart
 size is top normal and there is no pneumothorax although there may be a small
 right pleural effusion.  A left-sided dialysis catheter projects over the
 expected course to the mid right atrium and a  right subclavian line tip
 projects over the SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  Respiratory code.

 Comparison is made to a prior CT of [**2112-6-8**] and [**2112-6-6**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector low-dose images of the chest, and contrast-enhanced
 images of the chest following rapid bolus administration of 150 cc of IV
 Optiray were performed.  In addition, contrast enhanced images of the abdomen
 and pelvis were also performed.  Images of the chest were reformatted in
 sagittal and coronal planes.

 IV CONTRAST:  Nonionic IV Optiray contrast was used.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The study is slightly limited for
 evaluation of segmental pulmonary emboli.  However, pulmonary emboli are
 identified. There are large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
 dependent atelectasis. The aorta is normal in caliber without dissection.  The
 heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Coronary artery calcifications are
 noted.  No pericardial effusion seen.  Aerated lung is normal in appearance.
 Post surgical decompressive laminectomy of the upper cervical spine is noted.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The gallbladder is distended as seen
 previously, but otherwise unremarkable without evidence of inflammation; it is
 stable in appearance.  There is small perihepatic ascites. The liver, spleen,
 pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands, stomach, and bowel loops are unremarkable
 in appearance.  No free fluid or free air. Aorta is of normal caliber.  Note
 is made of expansion of the right psoas muscle with evidence of fluid-fluid
 level consistent with a hematoma. This likely extends from the patient's known
 right iliac muscle hematoma.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder and distal ureters are
 unremarkable.  No free fluid or masses.  Pelvic loops are normal.

 Bone windows show no suspicious lesions.  A total right hip arthroplasty is
 noted.  A screw of the right hip replacement extends well beyond the inner
 margin of the acetabular wall.

 INDICATIONS:  54-year-old woman status post mitral valve replacement for post-
 operative evaluation.

 CHEST, SUPINE AP PORTABLE:  There is an endotracheal tube in satisfactory
 position immediately beyond the thoracic inlet, approximately 3 cm above the
 carina.  The tip of the nasogastric tube lies in the fundus of the stomach.
 There is a chest tube overlying the right hemithorax.  Surgical clips are seen
 in the right upper quadrant, probably related to prior cholecystectomy.  Two
 tubular structures overlie the expected course of the right internal jugular
 vein, and at least one of these may represent introducer. A prosthetic mitral
 valve is visualized overlying the expected site in the heart.

 The heart is unremarkable.  The mediastinum is slightly widened with blurring
 of the borders, likely representing anticipated post-operative change. There
 are mild diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, seen on this supine film,
 which could represent pulmonary vascular congestion or layering pleural
 effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The surrounding osseous
 structures and soft tissue are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Status post mitral valve replacement, with multiple lines tubes
 and drains as described.  Bilateral opacities, which probably represent either
 pulmonary vascular congestion or layering bilateral pleural effusions.

 TECHNIQUE:  After the administration of IV contrast, a multidetector scanner
 was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the thoracic inlet to the
 pubic symphysis.  These were then reconstructed and reconfigured into coronal
 and sagittal planes.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is intubated.  There is a small
 10 x 5 mm focus of air within the left proximal subclavian vein.  The heart,
 great vessels are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  No pleural effusions or
 pericardial effusions are identified.  The bony thorax is unremarkable.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas,
 kidneys, and imaged bowel are unremarkable.  No lymphadenopathy is identified.
 No free fluid is seen.  There is no free air.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, prostate and
 seminal vesicles, rectum, and distal bowel are unremarkable.  No fractures are
 seen within the pelvis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  No fractures identified within the visualized appendicular or axial
 skeleton.  No solid or hollow visceral abnormalities seen.
 2)  Small focus of air in left subclavian vein, likely secondary to
 phlebotomy.

 Right subclavian central line is present, tip over right upper SVC.  A left
 subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter is present.  The tip is not optimally
 demonstrated, but probably lies in the proximal portion of the right main
 pulmonary artery.

 There is a moderately large right pleural effusion, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation, tracking medially to the right lung apex.  This is

 AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison made to a prior examination on
 [**2112-6-10**], performed approximately one hour previously.

 An NG tube passes beneath the diaphragm.  An endotracheal tube terminates in
 satisfactory position, 4 cm above the carina.  A right subclavian line
 terminates within the mid SVC.

 There is again seen mediastinal widening that is unchanged compared to the
 prior examination.  Bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left)
 appear to have increased.  There is also increased opacity within the left
 lower lobe when compared to prior examination which could represent increased
 effusion, atelectasis, or infiltrates.  No pneumothorax is seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Increased right sided pleural effusion and probable increased left-sided
 pleural effusion.
 3.  Increasing opacity within the left lower lobe, which could represent
 increased left-sided effusion or atelectasis.  An infectious component cannot
 be excluded.
 4.  Unchanged enlargement of the superior mediastinum.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of left below the knee amputation, for antibiotics.  IV
 was not possible to advance a PICC line.

 PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 7000**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1241**], with Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1241**], the Attending Radiologist, being present and supervising.  Dr.
 [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5359**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] reviewed this case.  The left upper arm was prepped in a sterile
 fashion. Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used
 for localization of a suitable vein. The brachial vein was patent and
 compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine, the brachial
 vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images were obtained, documenting patent vein before and
 after establishing access.  A 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy
 into the superior vena cava. Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was
 determined that a length of 44 cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was
 trimmed to length and advanced over a 4- French introducer sheath under
 fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was removed.
 The catheter was flushed.  A final fluoroscopic chest x-ray image was
 obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava just
 above the atrium.  The line is ready for use.Another left central line via
 the left IJ is already present also with tip in the SVC,

 A statlock was applied and the line was hep-locked.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 44 cm total length left-sided PICC line
 with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  55-year-old woman with morbid obesity with acute onset of chronic
 renal failure who needs a tunneled IJ Permacath for dialysis access.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3447**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3749**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1241**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1241**], the
 attending radiologist, was present and supervising the entire procedure. Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) **] d' [**Doctor Last Name **] reviewed this case.

 PROCEDURE:  After signed informed consent was obtained, the skin overlying the
 right lower neck region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 Under ultrasonographic guidance, using a 21-Gauge needle, the left internal
 jugular vein was accessed and a 0.018-guidewire was advanced into the superior
 vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a 4-
 French sheath and the micropuncture wire was then exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
 wire, which was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic
 guidance.  On the appropriate catheter length, the appropriate skin site
 overlying the left anterior chest wall was determined and a 1% lidocaine was
 used for local anesthesia.  A subcutaneous tunnel was then created with a
 blunt needle and the catheter was then advanced from the anterior chest wall
 to the lower neck incision site.  Serial dilators(8, 12 and 14Fr) were then
 used to increase the tract into the internal jugular vein and the catheter was
 then advanced through the peel-away sheath under fluoroscopic guidance.  Final
 chest x-ray documented the tip to be in the proximal right atrium.  The line
 is ready for use.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, without immediate
 complications.

 MEDICATIONS:  30 cc of 1% lidocaine, 1 cc of Versed, and 25 cc fentanyl.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 23-cm cuff-to-tip 14Fr angiodynamics
 tunneled dialysis catheter with the tip in the proximal right atrium, through
 the left IJ, ready to use.

 TECHNIQUE:  MRA examination of the right upper extremity was performed using
 both 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences with and without gadolinium.  There
 are no prior studies for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  An adequate study was performed from the aortic arch to the right
 elbow.  Imaging distal to the right elbow is severely limited due to residual
 gadolinium in the soft tissues (related to the MRA performed on [**2153-6-19**]).

 The ascending aorta and arch appear normal.  The right brachiocephalic and
 subclavian arteries are also normal in caliber.  A moderate degree of stenosis
 is seen within a 1-cm segment of the right axillary artery.  The remainder of
 the vessels (to the level of the elbow) are unremarkable.  Vasculature distal
 to the elbow cannot be evaluated.

 Limited evaluation of the chest shows no significant abnormality.

 IMPRESSION:  1-cm moderate stenosis  of the right axillary artery. No other
 significant disease noted to the level of the right elbow.

 Images were reformatted on a separate workstation and were essential in
 delineating the above pathology.

 Bilateral perihilar opacities are increased since the previous study,
 consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  Less likely, they may represent
 atypical pneumonia if the patient is immunosuppressed.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:  Moderate congestive heart failure.  Less likely, findings may
 represent atypical infection if the patient is immunosuppressed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Peripheral vascular disease, for IV access, needs heparin IV
 infusion.

 PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3749**] and [**Doctor Last Name **], with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
 the Attending Radiologist, being present and supervising.  The right upper arm
 was prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins were
 visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic
 vein was patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 3 cc of 1%
 lidocaine, the brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with
 a 21-gauge needle.  Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained, documenting
 patent vein before and after establishing access.  A 0.018 guidewire was
 advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based on the markers
 on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 40 cm would be suitable.
 The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4-French introducer
 sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath
 was removed. The catheter was flushed.  A final spot chest radiograph
 demonstrates the tip of the PICC in the superior vena cava, with a left IJ
 dialysis catheter terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein and a right IJ
 central venous line terminating in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.  A
 statlock was applied and heplocked.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 40 cm total length right brachial PICC
 line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.  Note, the left arm
 was not used for PICC placement secondary to a rash.

 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, [**2161-8-13**] AT 10:12 A.M.

 HISTORY:  Two-day-old boy who was born at term and has intermittent tachypnea.

 COMPARISON STUDIES:  Portable chest x-ray [**2161-8-11**].

 FINDINGS:  The patient is significantly rotated towards the right and in a
 lordotic position.  This likely accounts for an unusual appearance of the
 ribs, particularly superiorly on the right.  The lungs are hypoaerated.
 Improved bilateral pulmonary parenchymal opacities with mild residual
 interstitial prominence.  There may be thickening of the major fissure on the
 right, indicating a small amount of pleural fluid.  The cardiothymic
 silhouette is difficult to evaluate, but does not appear enlarged.  No bony
 abnormalities are appreciated.  Visualized bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Findings most consistent with nearly resolved transient tachypnea of the
 newborn on this study with unconventional positioning.

 2.  Unusual appearance of the ribcage, particularly on the right, likely
 related to positioning.  Recommend correlation with physical examination and
 perhaps a repeat frontal view of the chest with improved positioning.

 INDICATION:  Status post emergent airway at outside hospital on [**2186-9-10**].
 Evaluate for chest mass or lung disease.

 No prior chest CT scans are available for comparison.  Comparison is made to a
 chest radiograph performed earlier the same date.

 A tracheostomy tube is present, with the tip of the tube terminating at the
 level of the carina.  There are small lymph nodes within the mediastinum but
 none meet strict criteria for significant enlargement.  The heart size is
 normal, and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a trace
 right pleural effusion.

 Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a nonspecific 1.6 cm
 diameter left adrenal lesion.  The right adrenal gland is normal in
 appearance.  The remaining imaged portion of the upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.

 Assessment of the lungs demonstrates relatively symmetrical areas of bibasilar
 opacification with uniform enhancement.  No suspicious masses are identified,
 and there is no evidence of central airway obstruction.

 Skeletal structures demonstrate no significant abnormalities.

 CORONAL REFORMATION IMAGES:  These images confirm the presence of bilateral
 lower lobe, predominantly dependent opacities with air bronchograms.  The
 enhancement pattern appears uniform in the right lower lobe but is more
 heterogeneous in the left lower lobe on the coronal images.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tip of tracheostomy tube terminates at the level of the carina.

 2.  No evidence of central airway obstruction within the intrathoracic trachea
 or main stem bronchi.  Please see separately dictated CT of the neck for
 evaluation of the more proximal airway and the soft tissue structures of the
 neck.

 3.  Bibasilar dependent areas of parenchymal opacification, homogeneously

 INDICATION:  43-year-old woman with shortness of breath requiring emergent
 tracheostomy.  Please evaluate for a neck mass.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images through the neck after administration of IV
 contrast.

 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is seen entering the trachea just below the
 level of the hyoid bone.  Nasogastric tube is in place.  At the region of the
 arytenoid cartilages, there is prominence of the vocal cords.  Due to
 technical difficulties, there is not good contrast enhancement (please see CT
 of the chest of the same day); however, no significant enhancement is
 identified within this region in question.  The retropharyngeal and
 peritonsillar spaces appear unremarkable, and there is no evidence of abscess
 in this region.  Surrounding osseous structures are remarkable for a cystic
 lesion in the mandible filled with soft tissue material.  It is in the midline
 of the mandible, measuring 23 mm in greatest axial dimension.  Also seen is
 left maxillary mucosal sinus thickening.  The right mastoid air cells also
 appear opacified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Prominence of the vocal cords, but no definite enhancement seen.  Direct
 inspection may be useful for further evaluation.
 2.  No evidence of mass within the neck soft tissues.
 3.  Sinusitis in the left maxillary sinus.
 4.  Benign-appearing cyst in the midline of the mandible.  Please refer to the
 CT of the chest of the same day for further details regarding the lungs.

 team unable to place bedside PICC.

 PHYSICIAN: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 36098**] [**Name (STitle) 36099**].

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The patient was positioned supine on the angiography
 table. As no suitable superficial veins were present, the deep venous system
 of the right upper extremity was examined with ultrasound. The right brachial
 vein was found to be patent and compressible. Standard sterile prep and drape
 of the right arm. Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was
 used to puncture the right brachial vein. Hardcopy ultrasound images pre- and
 post-puncture were obtained. A 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the
 needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was
 exchanged for the micropuncture sheath. The PICC was cut to length based on
 the markers on the guidewire. The catheter was then advanced over the
 guidewire, through the sheath and its tip positioned at the superior vena
 cava-right atrial junction. The guidewire and sheath were removed. The
 catheter was fixed in place with a StatLock device. Both lumens of the
 catheter flushed and aspirated well, were capped and heplocked. A sterile
 transparent dressing was applied. Final limited chest radiograph confirmed
 catheter tip position at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction.

 COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.

 MEDICATIONS: Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.

 IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 36 cm long, 5 French dual-lumen PICC by
 way of the right brachial vein with catheter tip at the superior vena cava-
 right atrial junction. The catheter may be used immediately.

 INDICATION:  Status post bypass surgery, now with shortness of breath,
 evaluate for effusion.

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest examination demonstrates status post
 sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the left-sided
 anterior mediastinum consistent with previous bypass surgery.  The heart size
 is within normal limits and no pulmonary vascular congestive pattern can be
 identified.  There exist bilateral pleural densities blunting the lateral
 pleural sinuses, slightly more on the left than the right.  The lateral view
 confirms the pleural sinus blunting posteriorly.  Mildly accentuated kyphotic
 curvature of the thoracic spine exists and a diffusely demineralized spine
 with a mild wedge-shaped compressed deformity of vertebral body T9.

 Comparison with the preoperative PA and lateral chest examination of [**4-8**]
 is performed.  The heart size remains within normal limits and the pulmonary
 vasculature is unchanged.  The described pleural densities are more marked now
 but they existed to some degree already on the preoperative examination.  No
 new parenchymal abnormalities have developed.

 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory findings postoperatively.  No evidence of CHF or
 acute infiltrates.  Bilateral small pleural effusions remaining.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Confusion, assess for infarction.

 Multiple axial images are obtained from base to vertex without intravenous
 contrast administration.  Small foci of low attenuation are noted involving
 the periventricular white matter and the anterior limb of the internal capsule
 suggestive of areas of small infarct of uncertain dates.  No midline shift or
 mass effect is seen.  The ventricular system is symmetrical without
 hydrocephalus.  There is no extraaxial fluid collection.

 Hyperostosis frontalis is seen.  The posterior fossa structures are within
 normal and the fourth ventricle is in the midline.  There is no hydrocephalus.
 No major arterial distribution infarcts were present.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Small low attenuation is
 seen involving the periventricular white matter, nonspecific probably related
 to chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  Hyperostosis frontalis.  If there
 is clinical suspicion for an acute ischemic event, correlation with MRI would
 be helpful if clinically indicated.

 Additional catheters or wires overlie the mediastinum in addition to
 sternotomy wires and remain unchanged.

 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A left apical cap is again
 visualized.  Hazy areas of increased opacity are present bilaterally with
 associated vascular indistinctness, likely due to mild fluid overload.
 Metallic bullet fragment is noted in the right shoulder area, and note is made
 of a fracture of the left clavicle.

 INDICATION:  Status post mediastinoscopy.

 There has been interval removal of a left subclavian vascular catheter.  Other
 lines and tubes are unchanged in position, with persistent coiling of the
 nasogastric tube in the stomach, with distal tip directed cephalad.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences.
 There remains evidence of a left apical cap.  Just below this level, there is
 an enlarging rounded area of opacity, which extends medially to the left
 mediastinal contour.  A similar but smaller opacity is seen here on [**11-26**], [**2142**], but this appears new compared to a pre-chest tube removal radiograph
 of [**2142-11-23**]. Given the time course of development following chest
 tube removal, a loculated pleural fluid collection is favored over a pulmonary
 process. Regarding the remaining portions of the lungs, there is an improving
 area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region, and note is made of mild
 perihilar haziness in the right lung with otherwise clear appearance.

 COMPARISON:  Previous study earlier the same date at 2055.

 INDICATION:  Status post gunshot wound.  Reintubation.

 An endotracheal tube is advanced slightly in the interval, terminating at
 approximately the level of the carina.  A nasogastric tube coils within the
 stomach, and a left-sided chest tube remains in place.  There has been
 interval development of collapse of the right upper lobe.  Cardiac silhouette
 is upper limits of normal in size.  There is bilateral perihilar haziness.  A
 homogeneous opacity is noted at the left apex suggestive of an apical cap and
 fullness of the mediastinum suggestive of mediastinal hematoma. There is a
 fracture of the left clavicle, and there is an irregular lucency at the T1
 vertebral body as well as lucency overlying C7 vertebral body, which have been
 further evaluated by CT of the cervical spine.

 IMPRESSION:  1.  Low position of endotracheal tube, at approximately the
 carina level. Finding communicated with house staff caring for the patient.

 2.  Collapse of right upper lobe.

 3.  Left apical cap and findings suggestive of mediastinal hematoma.  Please

 INDICATION:  30-year-old paraplegic post-gunshot wound with fluid collections
 in the left neck, assess further.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the neck with IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray were used for
 this examination.

 Comparison is made to chest CT performed [**2142-12-17**].

 FINDINGS:  Streak artifact from a right subclavicular bullet as well as spinal
 fusion hardware in the lower cervical spine limits evaluation in the region of
 the lower cervical spine and superior clavicular areas.  There is likely a
 fluid collection seen in the left lung apex region, which probably is
 unchanged in appearance.  No other definite focal fluid collections are
 identified within the neck or lung apices.  There is no significant
 lymphadenopathy within the neck.  The parotid glands appear normal.  A
 tracheostomy tube is present.  The thyroid is normal.

 Osseous structures demonstrate fusion hardware at T1 through T3 with an
 intervertebral cage and anterior vertebral screws.  Normal contrast
 enhancement is seen within the internal carotid arteries.  The visualized
 portion of the upper lung fields demonstrate scarring at the left lung apex.
 The visualized portion of the brain is normal.  Fluid is seen within the
 sphenoid sinus.

 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat limited evaluation of the region of interest due to
 streak artifact.  However, there is probably a fluid collection in the left
 lung apical region as seen on the prior CT scan of the chest on [**2142-12-17**].  Fluid within the sphenoid sinus may represent sinusitis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  57-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on
 hemodialysis through temporary dialysis line in right internal jugular vein,
 needs tunneled dialysis catheter.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3714**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
 Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the attending radiologist was present and supervising throughout the
 procedure.

 After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient, written informed
 consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
 table.  The right neck, right upper chest and preexisting hemodialysis
 catheter was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Pre-procedure
 timeout was performed to confirm the patient's name, procedure, and the site.
 10 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied at the right upper chest where the tunnel
 will be created.  Then a small skin incision was made approximately 10 cm away
 from the right internal jugular vein access.  A tunnel was created by using
 tunnel device.  A 20 cm hemodialysis catheter was placed through the tunnel. A
 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through the preexisting catheter under
 fluoroscopic guidance, with the tip in the inferior vena cava.  After the
 preexisting catheter was removed, the access was dilated by using 12- and 14-
 French dilators.  A 14-French peel-away sheath was then placed.  The
 hemodialysis catheter was then placed through the sheath.  The peel-away
 sheath was then removed.  A final film confirmed the tip of the catheter was
 located in the superior vena cava.  The lumen was flushed and the catheter was
 secured to skin with sutures.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter through the
 right internal jugular vein with the tip in the superior vena cava.  The
 catheter is ready to use.

 INDICATION: 57-year-old man with end-stage renal disease. Needs dialysis.

 PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5387**] [**Name (STitle) 1374**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1036**]
 [**Name (STitle) 1037**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6291**] and supervising. The right neck was
 prepped in a standard sterile fashion. The right internal jugular vein was
 found to be patent and compressible by ultrasound. For local anesthesia with
 1% lidocaine, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a 21-gauge
 needle under ultrasonographic guidance. A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced
 under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The needle was
 exchanged for an introducer sheath. The 0.018 guidewire was exchanged for a
 J-tipped 0.035 wire, which was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the
 IVC. The introducer sheath was exchanged for 12 and 14 French dilators used
 to dilate the access tract. The 14 French dilator was exchanged for a 14-
 French 20 cm temporary dialysis catheter, which was advanced under
 fluoroscopic guidance into the right atrium. The wire was removed. The
 catheter was flushed and capped. It was secured to the skin with 0 silk
 sutures. A final fluoroscopic chest radiograph was obtained, documenting the
 catheter tip in the right atrium. The dialysis catheter was hep-locked. It
 is ready for use.

 There were no immediate post-procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 14-French, 20 cm temporary dialysis
 catheter via the right internal jugular vein with tip in the right atrium,
 ready for use.

 INDICATION:  Widened mediastinum on portable chest x-ray and hypotension.
 Evaluate for aortic dissection, right lung pathology given pneumothorax and
 question of trapped lung.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of the previous day.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained without
 contrast.  Subsequently, following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray,
 contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained during opacification
 of the aorta and pulmonary artery.  Coronal, sagittal, and oblique
 reconstructions were obtained.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  The aorta is of normal caliber.  There is no evidence of
 thoracic aortic dissection.  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is a right-sided chest tube
 in place.  This chest tube enters the chest at the lateral chest wall, and is
 oriented posterior to the lung in the mid chest.  The tip of the chest tube
 approximates the medial most portion of the right pleura, adjacent to the
 spine.  There is a small anterior pneumothorax present.  Right upper and
 anterior lung appears fairly well aerated, and there is some atelectasis of
 the right lower lobe.  There is opacity of a fair amount of this right lung
 parenchyma, which may represent atelectasis with or without superimposed edema
 or infiltrate.  There is ground-glass and patchy opacity within the right lung
 as well, suggesting edema and/or infiltrate.  The heart is large.  There are
 coronary artery calcifications.  There are calcifications of the aorta.  The
 central airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
 There are small prevascular lymph nodes within the mediastinum measuring about
 9 mm in short axis dimension.  There are couple of pretracheal lymph nodes as
 well, measuring roughly the same.  These are borderline in terms of criteria
 for pathologic enlargement.  The mediastinum likely appears widened on chest
 x-ray due to mediastinal lipomatosis.  No pathologically enlarged axillary
 lymph nodes.  Subcutaneous air is noted adjacent to the chest tube entry site
 on the right.

 Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, reflux of contrast is noted
 within the IVC and hepatic veins.  Visualized portions of the liver and spleen

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2157-1-21**]

 COMPARISON:  [**2157-1-20**].

 INDICATION:  Reevaluate pleural effusion.

 Due to incomplete imaging of the periphery of the right lung, the right
 pleural effusion cannot be accurately assessed.  The imaged portion of the
 loculated effusion in the right mid lung zone peripherally is unchanged.  A
 pigtail pleural catheter is noted at the right lung base, new in the interval,
 and the previously present chest tube in the mid portion of the right chest
 has moved slightly in position.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain
 widened, and there is a persistent pattern of congestive heart failure.  Small
 left pleural effusion is noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Incomplete assessment of right pleural effusion due to exclusion
 of the peripherl right lung base from the radiograph.  Repeat radiograph is
 suggested at no additional charge to the patient.

 STUDY:  CT torso.

 INDICATION:  Patient with low sodium and query SIADH.  To rule out focal
 intra-abdominal malignancy.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT acquisitions of the abdomen and pelvis were
 acquired after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast.

 COMPARISON:  Reference made to CT from previous day of chest.

 REPORT:

 CT THORAX:

 Patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube lies in good position.
 Again noted there is extensive consolidation throughout lung bases,
 particularly posteriorly. No evidence of discrete parenchymal lesions
 identified, although a few well- rounded foci of consolidation are identified.
 Again some of these are of ground glass attenuation.  The overall pattern and
 distribution is unchanged significantly from previous day.
 Contrast was administered in this location.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 embolism.  An NG tube is in situ.  There is a small pericardial effusion.

 CT OF ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.

 The examination is suboptimal due to technical factors.  Allowing for this
 limitation, a reasonable single phase contrast view of the abdomen and pelvis
 was performed. It shows normal liver, without evidence of focal hepatic mass.
 A few small perihepatic lymph nodes and portal lymph nodes are seen.  The
 gallbladder shows no evidence of stones.  There is no intra- or extrahepatic
 biliary dilatation.  The spleen appears unremarkable.  NG tube is seen coiled
 in the stomach.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:

 Both kidneys show good uptake and excretion of contrast.
 No evidence of ureteric or bladder mass is seen.
 Prostate appears of normal size.  No pelvic lesions are seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large right pleural effusion, minimal lung reexpansion.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was performed from the thoracic inlet through
 the adrenals without injection of intravenous contrast.

 Comparison done to the chest radiograph of [**2157-1-19**] and CT of [**1-7**], [**2156**].

 FINDINGS: A moderate, partially loculated right pleural effusion explains
 right lower lobe atelectasis. A right chest tube traverses the lateral aspect
 of the major fissure to the dependent posterior portion of the effusion.  The
 high radiodensity of the effusion is likely an artifact rather than an
 indication of hemorrhage. There is also a small layering left pleural
 effusion.

 Images were obtained, at least in part, during expiration. Generalized
 tracheobronchomalacia starting at the level of the aortic arch extending to
 the segmental level, is more significant on the left. The bronchus intermedius
 is narrowed to 7 mm.

 There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy with the enlarged prevascular node
 measuring 14 mm and right upper paratracheal node measuring 17 mm.  There is
 significant cardiomegaly with severe coronary artery calcifications.  There is
 no pericardial effusion.

 In the upper abdomen, the imaged portions of liver, spleen, and adrenals are
 unremarkable.  There are no bone findings suspicious for malignancy.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Moderate, partially loculated right pleural effusion.  Chest tube course
 includes lateral aspect of the major fissure, tip in the dependent component.
 Right basilar atelectasis.

 2.  Small dependent left pleural effusion.

 3.  Severe tracheobronchomalacia.

 INDICATION:  Pacing lead placement.

 A permanent pacemaker has been placed, with a lead terminating in the expected
 location of the right ventricle.  There is also a second wire, which
 overlies the region of the left subclavian vein.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax on this semi-upright chest radiograph, but a fully upright view
 would be more sensitive.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  An
 area of patchy opacity at the right base appears slightly increased in the
 interval, and there is a new area of linear opacity in the right mid lung zone
 region.  The left lung is grossly clear.  A tracheostomy tube remains in
 satisfactory position.

 IMPRESSION:  Status post pacemaker placement with lead terminating within the
 right ventricle.  Second wire overlies the region of left subclavian vein.  No
 pneumothorax evident on this semi-upright radiograph, but fully upright
 radiograph would be helpful to fully exclude pneumothorax.

 generalized vascular plethora.  Tip of the NG tube is poorly visualized but
 below the diaphragm and satisfactorily positioned ET and left subclavian
 lines.  Right chest tube in the mid lung and a second pigtail catheter
 probably lying in the posterior right lung sulcus although this is conceivably
 below the diaphragm.  There is a large-bore multilumen catheter probably via
 right IJ approach with its tip just reaching right atrium.  Left effusion
 layering in recumbent position.  I doubt the presence of focal consolidation
 although this cannot be excluded in the left lower lobe.  Since exam one day
 previous the NG tube has been placed with otherwise little change.

 INDICATION:  30-year-old woman with bradycardia, needs IV access for fluids.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1037**] was performing the procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique, local anesthesia, and ultrasound
 guidance, the left basilic vein was localized and punctured under direct
 ultrasound guidance.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the wire.  A
 dual lumen PICC line was then placed over the wire through the sheath and its
 tip positioned in SVC under direct fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the
 catheter was confirmed by chest x-ray in one view.

 The peel-away sheath and the wire were then removed.  The catheter was secured
 to the skin.  The total length of the catheter was 46 cm.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after vascular access
 documenting vessel patency.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided dual lumen
 PICC line placement via the left basilic vein with the tip in the SVC.

 [**Name (STitle) 29638**] being present and supervising.  The right upper arm was prepped in a
 sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound
 was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The brachial vein was patent
 and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 liters of 1% lidocaine, the
 brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge
 needle.  A 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior
 vena cava.  Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a
 length of 38 cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and
 advanced over a 4-French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into
 the superior vena cava.  The sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A
 final chest x-ray was obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the
 superior vena cava just above the atrium.

 The line is ready for use.

 A StatLock was applied and the line was hep-locked.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 38 cm total length single lumen PICC line
 with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.

 Lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  Heart is at the upper limits of normal or
 slightly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  Mild prominence of
 the right paratracheal soft tissues likely reflects vascular ectasia in
 someone of this age.  No CHF, infiltrate, or effusion is identified.
 Subsegmental atelectasis or scarring is present at both bases.  Minimal
 blunting of both costophrenic angles is noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Probable emphysematous change and bibasilar scarring.  Borderline
 cardiomegaly.  No acute pulmonary process identified.

 INDICATION:  Status post MVC, C-spine injury and fever.

 CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  Comparison made to prior study of one day earlier.
 There is a tracheostomy tube.  The tip of the tube appears angled to the left,
 abutting the left wall of the trachea.  There is a left subclavian central
 venous line with tip in the upper superior vena cava.  Mild cardiac
 enlargement is noted.  There is increased density in the right lower lung zone
 likely representing effusion. Improved right lower lobe atelectasis is noted.
 Unchanged left retrocardiac opacity is present, likely representing
 atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Tracheostomy tube angled with tip towards the left tracheal wall.  This
 may be due to traction on the tube.

 2.  Improved right lower lobe atelectasis.

 These results were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39994**] on [**2180-12-20**].

 HISTORY:  Trauma, fall.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the lung apices to
 pubic symphysis were acquired following the administration of 150 cc of IV
 Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered secondary to trauma protocol.
 Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  An endotracheal tube is present with tip at
 the carina.  There is no pneumothorax.  Air-space consolidation is
 demonstrated within both lower lobes bilaterally, as well as within posterior
 segment of the right upper lobe.  There are no pleural effusions.  The airways
 are patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.

 Prominent precarinal lymph node is noted measuring 14 mm.  No other
 pathologically enlarged axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes are seen.  The
 aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection.  No mediastinal
 hematoma is seen.  Coronary artery calcifications are seen in the distribution
 of the right and left circumflex as well as left anterior descending arteries.
 The heart is enlarged. The pericardium, and great vessels are otherwise
 unremarkable. There is no pericardial or pleural effusions.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Nasogastric tube is seen with tip coiled
 in the stomach.  Within the left lobe of the liver, there is a 16-mm well-
 defined low attenuation cyst present.  The liver otherwise appears
 unremarkable, without evidence of intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The
 adrenal glands demonstrate a nodular contour without evidence of a focal mass.
 The spleen appears heterogeneous, which is likely due to normal variation in
 enhancement. No splenic lacerations or perisplenic fluid collections are
 identified. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The pancreas is atrophic, but
 otherwise appears unremarkable without evidence of focal mass or
 peripancreatic stranding. Within the interpolar region of the left kidney,
 there is a  2.7-cm simple cyst present.  Additionally, within the upper pole
 of the right kidney, there is a subcentimeter low attenuation lesion noted,

 too small to fully characterize. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically. There is
 no free air or free fluid.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
 retroperitoneal lymph nodes are demonstrated.  The aorta is heavily calcified,
 but does not demonstrate any evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.
 The stomach, and loops of large and small bowel appear unremarkable without
 evidence of bowel obstruction.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is noted within the
 bladder, which is collapsed.  Scattered diverticula are seen within the
 sigmoid colon.  The pelvic loops of bowel otherwise appear unremarkable.  The
 uterus, adnexa, and distal ureters are all within normal limits.  There is no
 free fluid.  No inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy is demonstrated.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There is a minimally displaced fracture involving the left
 anterior third rib.  Marked degenerative changes are seen within both
 shoulders which is incompletely imaged on this examination.  Additionally,
 degenerative changes are seen throughout the axial skeleton.  Mild grade I L4
 on L5 anterolisthesis is also demonstrated.

 CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
 confirming the above findings.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Endotracheal tube with tip at the carina.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14128**] was informed of
 these findings at 5:50 p.m. on [**2191-10-24**].

 2.  Parenchymal air space opacities involving the posterior segment of the
 right upper lobe and dependent portions of both lower lobes, likely
 representing atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.

 3.  Minimally displaced fracture of the left anterior third rib.

 4.  Simple hepatic cyst and simple left renal cyst.  Tiny hypodensity within
 the right kidney, too small to fully characterize, but also likely represents
 a cyst.

 5.  No evidence of acute traumatic injury within the abdomen or pelvis.

 HISTORY:  Transferred for OSH.  Status post intubation.  Evaluate tubes and
 lines.

 FINDINGS:  An AP supine portable chest radiograph shows an endotracheal tube
 in place with the tip ending 4.5 cm above the carina.  Catheter projected over
 the right internal jugular vein seen with the tip projecting at the level of
 the mid to distal SVC.  Central venous catheter on the left and at the distal
 brachiocephalic veins, not reaching the SVC.  No pneumothorax seen on this
 side.  A nasogastric tube is seen with the tip and side hole both well below
 the left hemidiaphragm, with the tip off the view of the film.

 Lung volumes are small, crowding the central pulmonary vasculature which is
 probably not congested.  Bilateral pleural effusions, however present and
 probably some subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base.

 CONCLUSION:  Supporting tubes and lines positioned as described.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions and small lung volumes.

 INDICATION:  High fever and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolus.

 COMPARISON:  [**2142-12-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained following
 the administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast, during opacification of the
 pulmonary artery.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions as well as oblique
 reformatted images were obtained.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  No pulmonary embolus is identified.  The aorta is of normal
 caliber and is unremarkable.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Small fluid collections at the left apex are
 unchanged in size from [**12-15**], measuring roughly 1.9 cm in diameter.
 There is no pleural effusion.  There is a small pericardial effusion, likely
 not significantly changed.  There remains a similar degree of consolidation
 versus atelectasis at the left base.  Consolidation versus atelectasis at the
 right base has improved, with minimal linear atelectasis present.  No lung
 nodules are identified.  The irregular parenchymal opacity at the left lung
 apex is unchanged in size and appearance.  Central airways are patent to the
 level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There are some new patchy opacity
 within the lingula at the extreme lung base.  Within the left axilla, there is
 a lymph node measuring 9 mm in short axis with a fatty hilum.  No
 pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are noted.
 Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.  The patient is post-median
 sternotomy.  Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the visualized
 liver and spleen are unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions. Median
 sternotomy wires are unchanged, as is cervical spine hardware.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
 2.  Relatively unchanged small fluid collections in the left apical
 prevertebral region.
 3.  Left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation is unchanged.  Right
 lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation is improved, with minimal linear
 opacity remaining.
 4.  Small pericardial effusion, likely not significantly changed since the
 prior exam.

 FINDINGS:  The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed with the right CVL now in
 place, tip in the SVC and no PTX.  Tracheostomy tube and fusion material are
 unchanged.

 Shrapnel fragment overlies the right clavicle.

 There is some clearing of the right lower lobe airspace density and a bit more
 prominence of the left pulmonary vasculature.  The latter may be due to a
 difference in positioning of the individual.  The retrocardiac area is again
 obscured suggesting atelectasis or pneumonia.

 Status post sternotomy, with moderately severe cardiomegaly and a cardiac
 valve.  A single lead left-sided pacemaker is present with lead tip over right
 ventricle.  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Equivocal slight upper zone redistribution.
 Effusions are considerably increased compared with [**2156-1-2**]. The left effusion
 is similar to [**2156-1-21**]; the right effusion may be slightly larger.  Prominent
 main pulmonary artery noted, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. ?
 bronchiectasis. No pneumothorax detected.

 Incidental note is made of a focal well circumscribed lucent area in the left
 humeral medial metaphysis, with thin sclerotic rim -- the most likely etiology
 is a benign nonossifying fibroma.

 CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are two low attenuation fluid collections in
 the left lung apex in the prevertebral area.  These both measure 2 cm in
 diameter and are unchanged from the prior study.  An irregular parenchymal
 opacity is present at the left lung apex, which has decreased in size in
 comparison to the prior study.  Attenuation fluid is present anterior to the
 aortic arch and above the pulmonary artery, likely representing fluid within a
 pericardial recess.  There is a small amount of pericardial fluid, which has
 increased slightly from the prior study.  A right subclavian central venous
 line is present with tip in the lower superior vena cava.

 Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is present.  The osseous structures and

 CT.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck from [**2142-11-18**], CT of the chest from
 [**2142-12-6**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the neck were obtained after the administration of
 intravenous contrast.

 CT OF THE NECK:  A tracheostomy tube, median sternotomy wires, as well as
 hardware from an anterior spinal stabilization and cage placement at the C6
 through T2 levels are identified.  The comminuted fracutes of the posterior
 elements of C7 and T1 are again seen.  A bullet fragment lodged adjacent to
 the right scapula creates streak artifact. There is a well- demarcated
 approximately 4.2 x 4.2 cm collection in the right trapezius muscle, which is
 of fluid attenuation with a more hyperattenuating peripheral ring.  As seen on
 the recent CT, there is an abnormal fluid collection in the superior
 mediastinum, left of midline; this area is not well assessed on the current
 study given the streak artifacts.  No pathologic cervical lymphadenopathy is
 identified. There are no masses or abnormal collections in the superior neck.
 There are extensive nasopharyngeal secretions as well as collapse of the upper
 airway, related to the presence of a tracheostomy.  Again seen is an opacity
 in the left lung apex as well as fluid in the left pleural space.

 IMPRESSION:  Large fluid collection in the right trapezius muscle and smaller
 fluid collection in the left superior mediastinum, both of which appear to be
 along one of the bullet trajectories.  These areas could represent
 serosanguinous fluid or subacute hematoma, and infection cannot be excluded.

 SEMI-ERECT AP PORTABLE CHEST:  The lung apices are partially excluded from
 examination.  The tip of the tracheostomy tube remains in similar position.
 The leads of the pacemaker again project over the expected locations of the
 right atrium and right ventricle in this single view.  Sternal wire sutures
 are again noted.  A PICC entering from the left upper extremity ends just
 beyond the left axilla.  The heart size is unchanged.  The left retrocardiac
 opacity persists.  The visualized portions of the right lung remain clear.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Unchanged pacemaker lead position in this single projection .  A
 conventional two-view chest examination could confirm their positions.

 2.  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity probably representing atelectasis.

 3.  No pneumothorax seen, although this examination is somewhat limited, as
 above.

 CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW

 INDICATION:  Status post right subclavian central venous line placement.
 History of MVC and intubated.  C-spine injury.

 FINDINGS:

 AP single view has been obtained with the patient in supine position and is
 analyzed in direct comparison with a similar preceding examination of [**12-20**].  A tracheal cannula is identified and seen to be in moderate asymmetric
 position with its distal portion pushing towards the left-sided tracheal wall.
 This finding was already observed to a somewhat lesser degree on the preceding
 study and the recommendation to check again the cannula position is
 reiterated.

 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The left-sided subclavian central
 venous line is in unchanged position.  During the interval, a right-sided
 subclavian central venous line has been placed and is seen to terminate
 overlying the SVC just 1 cm below the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax
 has developed.  No new pulmonary infiltrates are seen and the lateral pleural
 sinuses remain free.  Left-sided retrocardiac density and inability to
 identify lower portion of descending aortic contour is suggestive of some
 atelectasis in this area.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of right-sided subclavian central venous
 line.  Recommend attention to unusual position of tracheal cannula.

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study from [**2157-1-14**].

 There is again seen a right-sided chest tube.  This is unchanged in position.
 There is a right-sided central venous catheter with its distal tip in the
 right atrium, also unchanged.  There is marked cardiomegaly, unchanged.  There
 is a persistent right-sided pleural effusion; allowing for differences in
 technique, is also unchanged.  There are low lung volumes, likely due to poor
 inspiratory effort.  There is again seen prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema.  The left lateral chest wall has
 been cut off from the study.  No pneumothoraces are identified on this
 portable semi-upright film.

 IMPRESSION:

 No significant interval change.  There remains cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema,
 and right-sided pleural effusion.

 Chest pain.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.

 There is a small right pneumothorax, best seen along the upper right lateral
 chest wall, unchanged compared with earlier the same day.  The chest tube
 remains present, though it may have retracted slightly in the interim, as the
 side port now lies closer to the right chest wall.

 There are low inspiratory volumes. The interstitial markings are diffusely
 prominent, essentially unchanged. Interstitial markings are of uncertain
 etiology - - ? CHF, infection or inflammation. A small right pleural effusion
 is also unchanged.

 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is quite prominent, but unchanged compared
 with multiple prior studies since [**2157-1-6**].

 AP CHEST, 5:33 A.M. ON [**12-19**]

 HISTORY:  Intubated following motor vehicle accident.  Pulmonary infiltrates.
 Question ARDS.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-16**] and 27.

 Tip of the ET tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, nearly 8 cm from
 the carina and 3 cm above optimal placement.  Tip of the left subclavian line
 is at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  Lung volumes have improved,
 mild pulmonary edema has cleared, and there has been some decrease in the
 region of consolidation in the infrahilar right lower lung.  Followup advised
 to document continued clearing of aspiration or contusion.  Heart size is
 normal, although the configuration suggests left ventricular enlargement.
 Suggest clinical evaluation to exclude cardiac contusion.  Border of the
 cardiac apex is also very sharply defined which is occasionally the sign of an
 anteriorly collected pneumothorax in the supine patient, if feasible.  I would
 recommend upright or, if the patient most remain recumbent, a reverse
 Trendelenburg view to exclude pneumothorax.

 COMPARISONS:  [**2180-12-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.  The
 mediastinum has a normal size.  Examination of lung windows demonstrates
 consolidation of the right lower lobe, likely related at least partially due
 to mucous plugging.  Infection is not excluded. In addition, there is mild
 patchy opacity at the left lower lobe basilar segments posteriorly, which
 probably represents a combination of atelectasis and consolidation.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
 adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and small bowel are unremarkable aside from
 a renal cyst in the interpolar portion of the left kidney.  A densely
 radiopaque (metallic) focus is seen between the stomach and the spleen, which
 may actually be within the stomach or the gastric wall, and is new since
 [**2180-12-16**]. Mild nonspecific fat stranding is seen within the perirenal fat and
 Gerota's fascia.  There is no significant abdominal free fluid present.  There
 is no significant abdominal lymphadenopathy.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The large bowel, bladder, and visualized
 aspects of the distal ureters are unremarkable.  There is a Foley catheter
 present.  There is no significant pelvic lymphadenopathy, and minimal pelvic
 free fluid is also present.

 Note is also made of an Optease IVC filter, and gastrostomy tube is also
 present.

 Examination of osseous structures does not show lytic or blastic lesions
 suspicious for malignancy.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  45-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastric variceal
 bleeding.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3447**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3714**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9328**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66387**], and the
 attending Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 924**] who was present throughout the procedure.

 FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
 on the angiographic table.  Following induction of general anesthesia, the
 patient's right neck was prepped and draped sterilely.  The right internal
 jugular vein was accessed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with a
 21-gauge needle.  The puncture needle was exchanged over a 0.018 wire for a
 4-French catheter.  The 0.018 wire and inner stylet were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 112**]
 wire was advanced into the IVC.  The puncture site was progressively dilated
 and a 10-French long [**Doctor Last Name 66388**]-[**Last Name (un) 2526**] sheath was then placed over the wire with
 its tip positioned just below the diaphragm into the inferior vena cava under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  A modified 5-French C2 catheter was then advanced
 through the sheath over a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 112**] wire and its tip engaged in the hepatic
 vein.  The catheter was then advanced into the periphery of the vein with the
 help of a 0.035 Glidewire.  A venogram was then performed demonstrating
 appropriate positioning of the tip of the catheter within the hepatic vein.
 The catheter was then removed and an occlusion balloon catheter was placed.
 The balloon was inflated in the peripheral hepatic vein and a portogram was
 performed in the AP and lateral projections using carbon dioxide as a contrast

 [**Doctor Last Name 1511**].  This confirmed the position of the catheter to be in the right hepatic
 vein and delineated the portal vein, which was widely patent.

 After the balloon occlusion catheter was removed, a 7-French metallic
 [**Doctor Last Name 66388**]-[**Last Name (un) 2526**] sheath was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 112**] wire through the vascular sheath
 until the tip was positioned in the mid portion of the right hepatic vein.  A
 14-gauge needle was then advanced through this protected sheath and a puncture
 was made through the liver parenchyma.  Good blood return was obtained and the
 injected contrast moved in the hepatofugal direction.  The 0.035 stiff
 Glidewire was advanced and a multi-sidehole infusion catheter followed into
 the presumed portal vein.  Contrast angiography was then performed
 demonstrating that the tip of the catheter was in fact positioned within the
 hepatic artery.  The catheter was then removed from the hepatic artery.  A
 14-gauge needle was then advanced through the sheath, through the parenchyma
 of the liver into the right portal vein branch.  A 5-French multi-sidehole
 catheter was then placed over the wire into the superior mesenteric vein and a
 selective venogram was then performed.  This revealed large varices arising
 from the splenic and proximal portal vein with numerous small varices arising
 from the distal main portal vein.  A stiff Amplatz 0.035 guide wire was then
 advanced through the catheter into the splenic vein and the catheter was then
 removed.  The liver parenchymal tract was then dilated with an 8-mm diameter
 balloon.  Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 10-mm diameter 68 mm long
 Wallstent was placed extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic
 vein.  The stent was then dilated with a 10- and 12-mm balloon, and a
 follow-up portogram was performed.  This demonstrated brisk flow through the
 shunt, but continuous opacification of the previously demonstrated varices of
 the portal and splenic veins.  A C2 glide catheter was then advanced over a
 0.035 wire into the large gastric varix and an attempt to deploy a 12-cm long
 coil was attempted.  However, the coil and the tip of the catheter were
 displaced into the portal vein.  Subsequent extraction of the coil with a
 snare was performed successfully with no residual coil present within the
 vasculature.  Subsequently, two large gastric varices were engaged with a
 Cobra catheter and 3 cc of absolute alcohol was injected into each varices
 with resulting slowing of the blood flow within those varices.  The Cobra
 catheter was then removed and replaced with a multi-sidehole infusion straight
 catheter.  Portal vein pressure was then measured to be 34 mmHg.  Pressure
 within the mid stent was 32 mmHg.  Blood pressure within the hepatic artery
 was 25 mmHg.  Pressure within the right atrium and right ventricle was 22
 mmHg.  Therefore, portosystemic gradient constituted approximately 9 mmHg.
 This was a significant reduction in the portosystemic gradient compared to the
 portosystemic gradient of 14 prior to deploying of the Wallstent.  Additional
 balloon dilatation of the shunt using 12-mm balloon over a 0.035-wire was
 performed with subsequent portal pressure measured 32 mmHg and the pressure
 within the IVC measured 23 mmHg.  The 10-French sheath was then removed over
 the wire and a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous catheter was

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  MVC, unresponsive, wide mediastinum on chest x-ray.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
 obtained after the administration of IV contrast.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  No evidence of aortic dissection.  No
 pericardial effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are bilateral
 predominantly posterior areas of dense opacification of the lung parenchyma
 with other scattered areas of opacity including a linear opacity in the left
 upper lobe and multiple ill-defined areas of ground-glass opacity.  No central
 obstructing lesions are seen.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen
 are grossly unremarkable.  An NG tube terminates in the stomach.  The adrenal
 glands have a normal contour.  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
 symmetrically.  There is a likely a renal cyst at the lower pole of the left
 kidney.  No hydronephrosis.  Loops of small and large bowel demonstrate no
 definite wall thickening.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A vascular catheter is present within the
 right femoral and external iliac arteries.  Stranding is noted in both groins
 bilaterally.  There is air tracking along the outer margin of the right
 iliopsoas muscle.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No rib fractures can be identified.  Images of the thoracic and
 lumbar spines demonstrate no loss of vertebral body height.  Disc spaces are
 maintained.  Alignment is normal.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple areas of dense lung parenchymal opacity predominantly in the
 posterior portions of the lung with other areas of ground-glass opacity and
 linear opacity in the lungs.  Diagnostic considerations should include

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  30-year-old woman with high fever.

 COMMENTS:  Enhanced CT scan of the chest was performed following the
 uneventful intravenous administration of contrast.  Spiral CT scan was
 performed encompassing both lungs.  Comparison was made with the previous
 study dated [**2142-11-21**].

 The patient is status post multiple gunshot wound with thoracic spinal
 fixation.  There are multiple surgical staples and screws seen in the lower
 cervical spine.

 There is a new area of fluid collection in the left prevertebral area in the
 lower cervical spine adjacent to the area of operation.  The fluid collection
 measures 2 cm in diameter, and located posterior to the left lobe of the
 thyroid and medial to the left carotid artery.  This finding is not present in
 the previous CT scan, and suspicious for abscess.  There is associated diffuse
 increased density of the mediastinal fat.

 Note is made of a low-density area within the right paravertebral muscle.  The
 etiology is uncertain, however, the differential diagnoses could include
 hematoma and infection.

 There is a small area of consolidation in the medial portion of the left upper
 lobe indicating atelectasis versus superimposed pneumonia.

 Previously identified pleural effusion and atelectasis in lower lobes have
 been markedly improved.

 The heart is normal in size.

 Multiple bullet fragment and bone fragments seen within the spinal canal in
 the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine.

 The visualized portion of the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
 within normal limits.  A nasogastric tube terminates in the gastric body.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified at
 the thoracic inlet.

 COMPARISON:  [**2142-11-27**].

 There has been a decrease in the loculated medial pleural effusion adjacent to
 the mediastinum on the left. Increased opacity at the left lower lobe is
 likely atelectasis or consolidation, though the lateral portions of the left
 hemithorax are not imaged.  The right lung is clear.  Tip of right subclavian

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable supine chest and AP portable pelvis.

 FINDINGS:
 AP CHEST:  An endotracheal tube is in place with tip terminating approximately
 2 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm with tip
 terminating in the gastric fundus.  There is a left-sided chest tube with tip
 directed inferiorly and medially.  The heart size is probably within normal
 limits.  Widening of the mediastinal contour is noted.  There is focal opacity
 at the right lung apex that could relate to aspiration versus pulmonary
 contusion.  No definite pneumothorax is identified.  No rib fractures are
 identified.

 AP PELVIS:  Visualization of fine osseous and soft tissue detail is limited by
 the presence of overlying trauma board artifact.  No fractures are identified
 within the pelvis and visualized portions of the proximal femurs.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Widened mediastinum could be consistent with mediastinal hematoma.  A
 chest CT is being performed for further evaluation.

 2.  Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.

 3.  Probable pulmonary contusion versus aspiration, right upper lobe.

 4.  No fractures identified.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
 the upper abdomen without and with intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reconstructions were obtained.

 CT chest with contrast [**2142-11-18**].

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There has been
 interval collapse of the right upper lung lobe. There has additionally been
 partial collapse of the left lower lobe, which may represent atelectasis
 versus consolidation.  The airways are patent to the segmental level
 bilaterally, including the bronchus to the right upper lung lobe. The left
 chest tube is again seen terminating in the left posterior lung zone. There
 has been interval development of a right pleural effusion. There remains a
 minimal amount of high density within the mediastinum, which may be secondary
 to venous blood. There is no evidence for pericardial effusion. The remaining
 great vessels are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The surrounding
 osseous structures show there has been interval median sternotomy with
 interval placement of spinal hardware secondary to a first thoracic vertebral

 INDICATION:  30-year-old female status post gunshot wound to neck.  Evaluate.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT contrast enhanced imaging of the neck was performed following
 the administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
 administered per protocol and coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 obtained.

 CT NECK WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The study is limited secondary to artifact
 and patient motion.  Allowing for this, there is no definite contrast
 extravasation from the great vessels in the neck or proximal branches.  High
 density fluid is seen throughout the mediastinum, possibly representing blood
 versus contrast leakage.

 Subcutaneous gas and high density fluid is seen in the right supraclavicular
 region, and behind the right latissimus dorsi muscle.  There is a bullet
 fragment lodged between the right clavicle and scapula, with no clear track
 identified.  The right subclavian artery is incompletly assessed.

 High density fluid and gas is seen anterior the the left pectoralis major
 muscle and tracks along the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, into the left
 supraclavicular space.

 The patient is intubated, with a nasogastric tube in place. The lung apices
 demonstrate changes consistent with contusions.  Subcutaneous gas and blood
 between the left chest wall and serratus anterior is most likely related
 recent chest tube insertion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, chest tube, right-sided pigtail catheter.
 Pigtail catheter was found open for a short time.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained with comparison to the
 examination performed one hour previously.

 FINDINGS:  The right costophrenic angle has been coned off of view.  There is
 an NG tube, which extends into the stomach.  There is an endotracheal tube
 present with the tip just at the thoracic inlet, unchanged.  There is a right-
 sided dialysis catheter, extending with the tip in the right atrium.  A left-
 sided subclavian central venous catheter extends to the distal aspect of the
 left brachiocephalic vein, probably just before the confluence into the
 superior vena cava.

 There is persistent cardiomegaly.  A retrocardiac opacity remains persist.
 Overall, the appearance of pulmonary edema is not significantly changed. A
 small left pleural effusion remains present, and there is a pleural line seen
 on the right lateral margin of the film, apparently representing a small
 right-sided pneumothorax. We're uncertain of whether this is a new finding.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right basilar pneumothorax.
 2.  Persistent appearance of failure, with left lower lobe retrocardiac
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.

 CHEST:  A single AP supine view is compared to previous examination of [**2156-2-7**].  Since the previous exam, there is suggestion of increased
 layering bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right.  There is associated
 compressive atelectasis.  The exam is limited due to motion artifact, however
 there is no significant change in the pulmonary edema.

 Again note is made of a Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in probably main
 pulmonary artery.  There is a single lead pacemaker with the lead overlying
 right ventricle.  The patient is status post MVR and median sternotomy.

 the same date at 6:28.

 INDICATION:  Pigtail pleural catheter removal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.

 A moderate-sized right pleural effusion is again demonstrated.  The previously
 questionable pleural line at the right base is not clearly visualized.
 However, if there is strong clinical suspicion for basilar pneumothorax, a
 left lateral decubitus view could be obtained to fully exclude this
 possibility.  The lung volumes are slightly increased compared to the recent
 radiograph.  There has been apparent slight interval improvement in degree of
 pulmonary edema.  There remains marked cardiac and mediastinal widening.  Left
 pleural effusion appears slightly improved in the interval.

 IMPRESSION:  No definite pneumothorax on the supine radiograph.

 AP chest radiograph shows endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.
 Nasogastric tube is seen with tip overlying the proximal stomach with the
 sideport near the GE junction.  Left subclavian catheter is seen with tip
 overlying the subclavian vein.

 There is evidence of right upper lobe collapse, with opacification, possibly
 representing aspiration.  The heart size appears within normal limits allowing
 for supine position.  Pulmonary vascularity appears normal with no evidence of
 edema.  There is evidence of some atelectasis in the retrocardiac area.  There
 is an unusual appearance to the posterior ribs, especially on the left side,
 however fractures are doubted.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior examination dated [**2156-2-4**].  There is a
 new Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip terminating in either the main pulmonary
 artery or proximal left pulmonary artery.  Exact location is uncertain,
 partially due to the relative lordotic positioning of the patient.  Otherwise,
 there has been no significant change.  There is no pneumothorax.  The large
 bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema are unchanged, allowing for

 cardiac decompensation.  The areas is previously ascribed to pneumonia are
 also improving, particularly in the right upper lobe indicating pneumonia was

 CHEST X-RAY FROM [**12-15**]

 HISTORY:  Status post multiple trauma.  Acute desaturation.  Line placement.

 An AP supine portable chest radiograph shows an endotracheal tube in place
 with the tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Left-sided subclavian
 central venous catheter appears unchanged compared to yesterday's study. There
 is now a Cordis introducer line projected over the expected area of the right
 subclavian vein and the tip terminates at the level of the confluence of the
 left and right brachiocephalic veins.  There is some increase in opacity at
 the uppermost right lung apex, which may indicate some pleural fluid in this
 supine patient.  No pneumothorax is seen on either side.  The patient's
 nasogastric tube has been advanced since yesterday's study.  All lung lobes
 are aerated and some fullness in the central pulmonary vasculature is not
 greater than what would be expected for supine positioning.  There is some
 vertical retrocardiac atelectasis on the left.  At the lower border of the
 film, the tip of the patient's IVC filter is visible.  A metallic spring
 device projected over the right upper mid chest is presumably outside the
 patient.

 CONCLUSION:  Right subclavian central venous Cordis ending at confluence of
 brachiocephalic veins.  Opacity at right lung apex may indicate some fluid.

 HISTORY:  Oxygen requirement, respiratory distress, CHF.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-4**] and 8th.

 Moderate right and left pleural effusions, right greater than left, have
 decreased since [**2-8**].  Aside from basal relaxation atelectasis, lungs
 are clear, though there is mild vascular congestion.  Large cardiac silhouette
 with a dilated pulmonary outflow tract and left atrium is stable.  Swan-Ganz
 catheter is looped in the main or proximal left pulmonary artery.  The patient
 has had median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.  Tip of a right
 jugular central venous line is obscured by transvenous right ventricular pacer
 lead, which is in standard placement.  Right PICC catheter ends at the
 junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right apical scarring, hyponatremia.  Evaluate for mass or
 infiltrate.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the chest was performed, correlated with chest
 radiographs performed over the last three days.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST  Extensive consolidation involves the
 posterior portions of both upper and lower lobes, with greater involvement in
 the right upper lobe than the left and in the left lower lobe than the right.
 At the margins of more non-dependent regions of consolidation are ground-glass
 opacities, and there are other patches of heterogenous peribronchial ground-
 glass opacity and ill-defined consolidation, predominantly in the inferior
 segment of the lingula and medial segment of the right middle lobe.

 There are no likely lung masses and no pleural effusion.  A small pericardial
 effusion is present.  Small axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymph nodes, do
 not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement.

 Airway secretions pool in the trachea above the endotracheal tube cuff and in
 the subsegmental bronchi particularly in consolidated lower lobes.

 An NG tube is coiled within the stomach.  Imaged portions of organs in the
 upper abdomen are normal. There are no bony lesions suspicious for malignancy.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral dependent consolidation likely represents a combination of
 retained secretions and atelectasi and possible pneumonia cannot be assessed.
 Nondependent areas of consolidation are more likely pneumonia. Aspiration
 suspected.
 2.  No suspicious mass lesions.
 3.  Small pericardial effusion, of uncertain clinical consequence.

 The patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube is identified 3 cm above the carina.  The tip of the right
 jugular Swan-Ganz catheter is not clearly seen by the motion, which is
 probably in the right main PA.

 The left chest tube and mediastinal drain remain in place.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  The previously identified mild congestive heart failure has been
 improving.  There is continued cardiomegaly.  The IABP marker, which is
 mentioned in the history is not clearly identified on the chest radiograph.

 AP chest radiograph shows stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes.
 Endotracheal tube is seen approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Stable
 position of pacing wires seen.  Swan-Ganz catheter is again seen with tip not
 definitely identified.  Median sternotomy wires and aortic valve prosthesis
 are seen.  Nasogastric tube is seen overlying the stomach although the tip is
 not seen on this image.

 There is a mild decrease in the previously seen moderate left-sided pleural
 effusion.  There has been interval re-development of a moderate right pleural
 effusion status after thoracentesis.  Again seen are bilateral airspace
 opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Opacity in the left lower lobe
 obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with left lower lobe
 atelectasis and.

 IMPRESSION:  Re-development of moderate right pleural effusion. Slight
 decrease in moderate left pleural effusion. Stable, mild pulmonary edema. Left
 lower lobe atelectasis.

 Endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position as well as a central venous
 catheter.  A nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach, but the side
 port is likely just above the GE junction level.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  Patchy and linear perihilar and basilar
 opacities show slight interval improvement in the interval and are most likely
 due to areas of atelectasis.  There are no new or worsening areas of
 abnormality to suggest an evolving pneumonia.

 INDICATION:  Removal of pigtail pleural catheter.

 There has been removal of a right pleural catheter.  There is a moderate-sized
 layering right pleural effusion.  There is a questionable component of
 hydropneumothorax at the right lung base, difficult to confirm on this
 apparently supine radiograph.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear
 widened, and there is vascular engorgement as well as diffuse perihilar
 haziness.  A layering moderate-sized left pleural effusion has apparently
 increased in size in the interval.  Endotracheal tube and vascular catheters
 are unchanged in position.

 1.  Partial resolution of right upper lobe collapse.
 2.  NG tube tip is in the stomach, although the sideport is probably above the
 GE junction.  Recommend advancing NG tube by at least 10 cm to ensure that
 both the tip and sideport are within the stomach.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to preoperative chest film on [**2148-10-16**]:

 Lung volumes are low, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is present.  Greater
 opacification at the lung bases is likely due to atelectasis.  Widening of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is more pronounced than usual.  Vascular
 engorgement in supine positioning may be wholly responsible, but mediastinal
 hematoma, particularly at the level of the aortic arch, cannot be excluded.
 Midline and bilateral pleural drains are in place.  There is no pneumothorax
 or large pleural effusion.  ET tube is in standard placement, Swan-Ganz
 catheter tip projects over the right pulmonary artery and a nasogastric tube
 ends in the stomach, which is not appreciably dilated.

 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2175-2-16**] and 13:

 Heterogeneous pulmonary opacification involving nearly all of the left lung
 and the right upper lobe which improved between [**2-19**] and 13 has
 worsened.  The asymmetry is concerning for pneumonia, although edema could
 have this unusual appearance, particularly if there is a component of acute
 mitral regurgitation.  Normal postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  ET tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular line are in
 standard placements.  No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.

 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 53**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2960**] and I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  Status post bypass surgery now postoperative day #2.  Patient has
 low-grade temperature.  Assess for pneumonia or atelectasis.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient in supine
 position is analyzed in direct comparison with a similar preceding study of
 [**2-15**].  The patient remains intubated with the ETT in unchanged position.
 The degree of lung inflation is somewhat lower than on the preceding study
 explaining the slightly higher position of the diaphragms and thereto related
 more crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on the right side.
 Position of the previously described right internal jugular approach sheath,
 Swan-Ganz catheter, NG tube and left-sided chest tube remain unchanged.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Slightly increased diffuse density over the right-
 sided hemithorax is best explained by some pleural effusion layering
 posteriorly in the patient in supine position.  The presence of the left-sided
 chest tube explains this density is not apparent on the left side.  Comparison
 also demonstrates that the previously described presence of an intraaortic
 balloon pump device in the aorta is not recognized anymore, apparently
 withdrawn.  Comparison is also made with the preoperative chest examination of
 [**2-13**], at which time the patient had sustained an acute ST elevation
 myocardial infarction.  Heart size remained within normal limits and a Swan-
 Ganz catheter advanced from below terminated in the main PA.  Also, an
 intraaortic balloon pump device was present in the aorta.  No pulmonary
 congestion existed.  Comparison shows that there is moderate degree of
 postoperative mediastinal widening which, however, has not changed
 significantly since [**2-15**] followup examination.

 IMPRESSION:  Intraaortic balloon pump device removed, no significant new
 pulmonary changes.

 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright view of the chest.  The endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes remain in good positions.  The right internal jugular
 central venous catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
 There is partial interval improvement in pulmonary edema.  There are
 persistent focal opacities in the right upper lobe, which most likely
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, but atelectasis or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Atelectasis is present in the left lower lobe.  There are
 persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.

 with stent.

 COMPARISONS:  None available.

 CHEST, SEMI-UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE:  There is a nasogastric tube, which passes
 into the stomach.  The lungs show bibasilar opacities, probably atelectasis
 which are otherwise clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 Allowing for technique, the mediastinal and hilar contours and cardiac
 contours are normal.

 There is a large amount of intraperitoneal free air.

 ABDOMEN, SUPINE PORTABLE:  Supine view of the abdomen also demonstrates a
 large amount of free air.  There are three double pigtail stents overlying the
 left upper quadrant.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
 cholecystectomy.  A clip is also present in the pelvis. There no dilated loops
 of small or large bowel to suggest obstruction.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large amount of intraperitoneal free air, status post cyst-gastrostomy.
 2.  Likely bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  No evidence of bowel obstruction.
 4.  Cyst-gastrostomy stents in the left upper quadrant.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the preoperative PA and lateral
 chest examination of [**10-4**].  There is now status post sternotomy and the
 presence of multiple surgical clips in the mediastinal area is compatible with
 previous bypass surgery.  The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the
 trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.  An NG tube has been passed
 and reaches below the diaphragm.  A right internal jugular approach sheath is
 noted and seen to carry a Swan-Ganz catheter terminating in the right-sided PA
 ___.  The mediastinal and a left-sided chest tube is noted in place.  The
 lungs remain aerated and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Plate
 peripheral atelectasis exists bilaterally in the mid lung fields, but no acute
 parenchymal infiltrates can be identified and the diaphragmatic contours are
 well delineated and the lateral pleural sinuses are free.

 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory first follow up examination to bypass surgery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  19-year-old man with trauma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
 obtained with multiplanar reconstructions.

 CONTRAST:  150 cc of IV Optiray was administered.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The study is somewhat limited secondary to
 inappropriate bolus timing.  The soft tissue window images reveal no
 significant axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. The heart,
 pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable. There are no pleural or
 pericardial effusions. An endotracheal tube is visualized with its tip about 4
 cm above the carina. The tip of the NG tube is in the stomach.

 The lung window images reveal a large right lower lobe consolidation.  Patchy
 opacity is also visualized in the right middle lobe.  Dependent atelectasis is
 also seen at the left lung base.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The left arm is over the abdomen causing
 beam hardening streak artifact in the upper portion of the abdomen.  The
 liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, kidneys and the abdominal
 loops of small and large bowel appear grossly unremarkable.  There is no
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air or free
 fluid.  NG tube noted in the stomach.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The pelvic loops of small and large bowel
 appear normal.  The prostate, seminal vesicles, and ureters appear normal.
 There is no free air or free fluid.  There is no pelvic or inguinal
 lymphadenopathy. Bladder contains foley catheter and gas.

 A fracture of the posterior rim of the right acetabulum is visualized with a
 small displaced bone fragment seen posteriorly.  Small osseous fragments noted
 in the hip joint.  Two foci of gas are anterior to the right femur neck.  No
 dislocations are visualized. The surrounding high densities along with soft
 tissue swelling consistent with hemorrhage. Small amount of air is visualized
 in the left hip joint with possibility of a small nondisplaced fracture.

 CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the above findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Necrotizing right-sided pneumonia, question hemothorax, question
 developing ARDS.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from [**2138-3-23**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed after the
 administration of intravenous contrast.

 There is a consolidative opacity with multiple foci of air involving the right
 lower lobe.  Throughout the right middle lobe as well as part of the right
 upper lobe are peribronchial ground-glass opacities. There is atelectasis at
 the left lung base.  The left lung is otherwise relatively spared with only
 two small foci of ground-glass opacities in the apex identified.  The patient
 is intubated and a nasogastric tube tip is seen coiling within the stomach.
 The heart, pericardium and great vessels appear unremarkable apart from
 extensive arterial calcifications.  There is a small right-sided pleural
 effusion measuring simple fluid attenuation.  There is no pathologically
 enlarged axillary lymphadenopathy.  Multiple borderline enlarged lymph nodes
 are seen in the right hilum and the precarinal regions.

 The visualized abdominal organs demonstrate extensive calcification of the
 splenic artery.  The visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands
 appear unremarkable.  There are small gallstones.  The osseous structures
 appear unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extensive consolidative opacity involving the right lower lobe with
 multiple foci of air within it.  This is consistent with the diagnosis of
 necrotizing pneumonia.  There is an associated small right pleural effusion of
 simple fluid attenuation.  There are multiple foci of ground-glass opacities
 in the right upper lobe as well as the right middle lobe, which could be
 infectious in etiology as well.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from four years ago.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning was performed after the administration
 of oral and intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were
 obtained.

 CT OF THE CHEST:  Again seen is a large area of consolidation with foci of air
 within the right lower lobe.  The surrounding right pleural effusion of simple
 fluid attenuation has increased in size since the prior study.  The multiple
 foci of ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe are stable or possibly
 slightly improved.  Heart and pericardium appear unremarkable apart from
 calcifications of the coronary arteries.  Again seen are prominent right
 paratracheal lymph nodes, unchanged.  Small amount of atelectasis is seen at
 the left base.  Emphysematous changes are seen in the left lung.  The great
 vessels appear unremarkable apart from calcifications of the aorta.  The
 airways are grossly patent.  An endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube are
 visualized again.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The liver, adrenal glands, spleen, and pancreas appear
 unremarkable.  Again seen are small gallstones within the full gallbladder.
 There is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema.  No pathologic
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.  The kidneys
 enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically.  Minor nonspecific stranding are
 seen around the kidneys.  Visualized loops of small and large bowel are normal
 in caliber and contour.  There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
 The vascular structures demonstrate calcification of the arteries.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:  A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.  There appears
 to be a rectal tube in place.  The prostate and seminal vesicles appear
 unremarkable.  The pelvic loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
 There is a small amount of nonspecific stranding within the pelvis.  There is
 no free fluid within the pelvis.  The osseous structures demonstrate no
 concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 HISTORY:  70-year-old woman status post resection of locally advanced colon
 cancer.  Assess for metastatic disease.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
 obtained with IV contrast.  150 cc Optiray.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large right thyroid nodule and small
 left thyroid nodule.  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  Aortic and coronary calcifications are identified.  The
 heart size is normal.  There is a moderate-sized pericardial effusion.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis, more prominent on the right.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are identified.  No definite pulmonary nodules are seen.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  No hepatic lesions are seen.  The
 gallbladder is distended.  The proximal pancreas is within normal limits.
 There is an abrupt transition in the mid body of the pancreas.  Distal to
 this, the pancreatic duct is dilated and the parenchyma is atrophic.  The
 spleen, adrenal glands, and left kidney are unremarkable.  Small low-
 attenuation focus in the upper pole of the right kidney may represent a cyst
 but is too small to be fully characterized.  The stomach is fluid filled.
 Small bowel loops are air filled.  Of note, there is thrombus within the left
 ovarian vein.  There is a small amount of intraperitoneal free fluid.  Small
 amount of intraperitoneal free air is identified.  Stranding along the midline
 is consistent with the surgical incision.

 CT PELVIS:  The bladder, uterus, adnexa, and rectum are unremarkable.  A
 staple line is seen in the region of the sigmoid colon.  There appears to be
 occlusion of the left limb of the aortobifem graft.  A small amount of flow is
 observed within the left common femoral artery and may be reconstituted by the
 inferior epigastric.  There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid.  No pelvic
 or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite evidence of metastatic disease.
 2.  Left ovarian vein thrombus which places the patient at risk for pulmonary
 embolism.

 There is a new left subclavian IV catheter probably terminating in the left
 innominate vein.  The possibility of arterial infection cannot be excluded
 from this radiograph.

 The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified at the thoracic inlet.  The
 right jugular IV catheter remains in place.  Again note is made of necrotizing
 pneumonia in the right upper lobe.  The lungs are clear otherwise.  The heart
 is normal in size.

 A nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.

 IMPRESSION:  The tip of the left subclavian IV catheter probably in the left
 innominate vein.  The possibility of aortic infection cannot be totally
 excluded from this radiograph only.  Continued necrotizing pneumonia in the
 right upper lobe.  Please confirm resolution of this pneumonia after
 treatment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MEDICAL HISTORY:  62-year-old man with right-sided necrotizing pneumonia. PICC
 needed for antibiotics, bedside PICC was unsuccessful.

 PROCEDURE: Performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 22919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], physician assistant, and Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6305**] [**Name (STitle) 6306**]
 and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1240**] [**Doctor Last Name 1241**], the attending radiologist,who was present and
 supervising throughout the procedure.  Since no suitable superficial veins
 were visible, the venous system of the right upper extremity was examined with
 ultrasound. The right basilic vein was found to be patent and compressible.
 Standard sterile prep and drape of the right arm.  Local anesthesia with 5 cc
 of 1% lidocaine was administered subcutaneously.  Using real-time ultrasound
 guidance, a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right basilic vein.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images pre and post puncture were obtained, documenting
 vein patency. A 0.018- inch guide wire was advanced through the needle into
 the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged
 for the introducer sheath. Then, a 5-French double- lumen PICC was cut to a
 length of 38 cm based on the markers on the guide wire.  The PICC was placed
 over the wire through the sheath and the wire and sheath were removed.  Both
 lumens of the catheter flushed and aspirated well, all capped and heplocked.
 The catheter was fixed in placed with a StatLock device and a sterile
 transparent dressing was applied.  Final limited chest radiograph confirmed
 catheter tip position in the SVC.  The catheter can be used immediately. There
 are no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 38-cm 5-French double-lumen PICC by way
 of the right basilic vein with the tip in the SVC.  The catheter can be used
 immediately.

 Portable chest radiograph compared to the preoperative film from [**2201-6-13**].

 The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina which is at least 2 cm above the
 desired level.  The NG tube is in stomach.  The Swan-Ganz tip is at the origin
 of the pulmonic valve.  The two mediastinal drains and the left chest tube are
 in standard position.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is comparable to the
 previous film due to the new supine position and postoperative changes.

 The lungs are clear except for new left lower lobe small atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-21**] through 21:

 The region of lucency projecting inferior to atelectasis and effusion at the
 base of the right lung has been an intermittent feature since [**32**]:30 p.m. on
 [**8-21**] when a nearly simultaneous abdomen CT showed no pneumoperitoneum, but its
 appearance is difficult to explain.  I would recommend a left decubitus view
 examining the right lateral thoracoabdominal region to see whether this is
 pneumoperitoneum or hyperaerated lung below an accessory fissure.

 Asymmetric opacification of the right hemithorax is due in part to a moderate
 right pleural effusion, as well as atelectasis at the base, but also a
 component of either unilateral pulmonary edema or global consolidation
 suggesting aspiration.  Aside from mild atelectasis at the base, the left lung
 is clear.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Tip of right subclavian line projects
 over the low SVC.

 Aside from a large area of central cavitation, the right upper lobe is

 HISTORY:  Right lung mass.  Right subclavian line placement.  Acute hypoxic
 respiratory failure.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-28**]:

 Consolidation which developed in the right lower lung and axillary portion of
 the left lung on [**9-28**] has continued to worsen consistent with pneumonia.
 Right upper lobe is fully consolidated but a round collection of air at the
 level of the first anterior interspace is likely at a large cavity.  The
 extent of any adjacent pleural abnormality is indeterminate given the
 homogeneous opacification of the lung peripheral to the cavity.  Heart is
 normal size.  ET tube, right subclavian line, and nasogastric tube are in
 standard placements. No pneumothorax.  There is probably a component of mild
 pulmonary edema, new since 4 a.m. on [**9-28**] and worsened slightly
 thereafter.

 INDICATION:  Fevers, sepsis.

 A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2128-8-23**] at 0810 hours and is
 compared with the prior mornings radiograph.  The patient has been extubated.
 Allowing for the change in technique and penetration, there likely has been
 little significant change in the appearance of patchy airspace disease in the
 right lung and left lower lobe.  Findings would be consistent with focal
 pneumonia possibly secondary to aspiration.  A right-sided subclavian line has
 its tip projecting over the SVC.

 IMPRESSION:

 Evidence of airspace disease in the right lung and to a lesser extent the left
 lower lobe with frank consolidation in the right lower lung field.  Findings
 would be consistent with multifocal pneumonia or aspiration which is not
 significantly changed since the prior examination.

 INDICATION:  42-year-old female with HIV/AIDS presenting with shortness of
 breath and hypoxia.  Rule out pulmonary embolus.

 COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**2139-4-7**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Initially a non-contrast CT scan of the chest was obtained.  This
 was followed by contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest in the pulmonary artery
 phase.

 FINDINGS:  The pulmonary artery is in the upper limits of normal size.  There
 are no filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.  The aorta is within
 normal limits without evidence of aortic dissection.

 There are multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes.  However, they do not meet
 CT criteria for pathology.  For example, a prevascular lymph node (image 3,
 109) measures 4 mm.  A precarinal lymph node (image 3/101) measures 6 mm.

 There is also a right hilar lymph node which measures 18 x 11 mm (image 3,
 85). The heart, pericardium and great vessels are unremarkable.

 When examining the lung fields, there are bilateral smooth septal thickening
 which could represent edema versus an atypical infectious process.  There is a
 more patchy opacity and ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe which
 could represent early pneumonia versus atypical infection.  There is again
 noted a scar in the right lower lobe, which is unchanged when compared to
 prior study.  No pulmonary nodules or masses are seen.

 Limited images of the upper abdomen without IV contrast demonstrate no
 calcifications within the kidneys bilaterally, most which are new or enlarged
 when compared to the prior study.  No new enlarged when compared to the prior
 study and likely represent renal stones.  The largest one in the left side
 measures 6 mm.  The largest one on the right side measures 6 mm.  There is no
 evidence of hydronephrosis in these images.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Smooth bilateral interlobular septal thickening could represent atypical
 infection versus pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  More
 patchy ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe could represent early
                                                             (Over)

 Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2118-8-9**] and to chest CT from
 [**2118-8-12**]. The hemodialysis catheter is inserted through the left
 subclavian line with its lower tip projecting at the level of the cavoatrial
 junction. The heart size is moderately enlarged but stable.  The bilateral
 perihilar and apical consolidations have substantially increased since the
 previous exam. In addition, there is significant worsening of the previously
 seen right lower lobe nodular opacities which seems to be now confluenting to
 large consolidation completely obscuring the right heart border.  The pleural
 surfaces are smooth with no significant pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Worsening of the consolidation right lower lobe suggests
 disseminated infection, although atypical pulmonary hemorrhage or pulmonary
 edema not excluded.

 HISTORY:  59 year old man with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, history
 of L1-2 discitis and epidural phlegmon for 6 months, now with fever of unknown
 origin.

 COMPARISON:  [**2118-8-4**] MRI lumbar spine.

 INTERPRETATION:

 Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior
 projections.  Multiplanar SPECT images of the chest and abdomen were also
 obtained.  There is abnormal focal increased tracer uptake involving the right
 aspect of the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies.  Marked diffuse cardiac uptake is
 demonstrated, which could be consistent with cardiac amyloidosis.  A transplant
 kidney is demonstrated in the right lower quadrant.  The urinary bladder is
 poorly visualized, consistent with patient history of impaired renal function.
 Increased diffuse soft tissue uptake is also noted, which could reflect altered
 distribution in the setting of impaired renal function.

 IMPRESSION:
   1.  Abnormal focal osseous uptake along the right aspect of the L1 and L2
 vertebral bodies which may represent osteomyelitis, though non-specific.  This
 will be correlated to the results of the white blood cell scan when available.
   2.  Marked diffuse cardiac uptake, which could be consistent cardiac
 amyloidosis.

 INTERPRETATION:  Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled
 with In-111, images of the whole body as well as a SPECT view of the chest and
 torso were obtained at 24hr.

 These images show lung uptake bilaterally: the right lung diffusely throughout
 and the left upper lung.  This is consistent with the patient's known pnemonia.

 There is mild increased activity at T12 and L1 largely discordant with the
 notably uptake seen in the recent bone scan of [**2118-8-15**] showing uptake at L1 &
 L2.

 There is uptake seen in the the right humerus and femurs suggesting expanded
 bone marrow.

 IMPRESSION:  1. Pneumonia  2. No convincing evidence for spinal osteomyelitis
 although In-111 white blood cells may have some decrease in sensitiviy in the

 HISTORY:  Chest tube clamped.

 Single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates a right mid lung airspace
 opacity, somewhat less conspicuous than seen on the radiograph obtained on
 [**2192-7-14**].  There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The
 left costophrenic angle is excluded from the imaged field of view.  The
 support lines remain unchanged in position.  A small-to-moderate right apical
 pneumothorax is evident on the current study.  Mild deviation of the trachea
 from the midline to the right is attributable to a tortuous aorta.  No

 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease and shortness of breath.  New need for
 oxygen.

 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**2118-7-31**]:

 There has been a substantial increase in perihilar pulmonary consolidation
 which is seen on the lateral view to lie in the upper and middle lobes, less
 so in the lower.  In addition, there are discretely nodular opacities seen in
 the lower lungs particularly on the right, all of which points to disseminated
 infection, alternatively progressive pulmonary hemorrhage, rather than
 pulmonary edema as suggested previously.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is
 stable and there is no appreciable pleural effusion.  There has been interval
 increase in thickness of the right paratracheal and mediastinal soft tissue
 probably combination of azygos vein distention, mediastinal fat deposition,
 and some increase in central adenopathy.  Left supraclavicular dual-channel
 dialysis catheter has been advanced to the lower third of the SVC.  There is
 no pneumothorax.

 Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42342**] at the time of
 dictation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE CHEST.

 There is a comparison CT from [**2192-6-25**].

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy, now
 shortness of breath following attempt at exchanging right central line.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the thorax were obtained pre- and post-IV
 contrast enhancement.  The exam is of sufficient quality to evaluate for
 pulmonary embolism to the level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries.

 CT CHEST FINDINGS:  There is no pulmonary embolism to the level of the
 subsegmental pulmonary arteries.  Pre-contrast images demonstrate no dense
 intramural hematoma in the aorta to suggest dissection.  Post-contrast images
 demonstrate a normal appearance of the aorta except for mild atherosclerosis.
 There is no pericardial effusion.  There is a small right pleural effusion.
 There is an enlarged lymph node at the aorticopulmonary window.  There is
 thickening of the soft tissues surrounding the trachea and main stem bronchi
 and hila.  These findings are presumably related to post-surgery.  Lung
 windows demonstrate a small right pneumothorax.  There are scattered
 emphysematous changes bilaterally.  There are airspace opacities which are
 patchy and bilateral.  Ground glass opacities are present throughout each lung
 as well as linear opacity at the bases.  A right chest tube is present with
 its tip in the pericardial fat.  There is subcutaneous emphysema on the right
 related to a chest tube placement.  Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or
 blastic lesions.  Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No pulmonary embolism as clinically questioned.

 2.  Pulmonary opacities most consistent with edema and postoperative infection
 or inflammation.  The changes are diffuse and bilateral.

 3.  Prominent appearance of the soft tissue in the mediastinum, presumably
 related to post-surgical changes.  Small pleural effusion on the right.

 4.  Right chest tube with its tip in the pericardial fat pad.  These findings
 were discussed with the clinical service on [**2192-7-12**].

 MRI RIGHT SHOULDER

 HISTORY:  59-year-old male with fever of unknown origin and right shoulder
 mass.

 TECHNIQUE:  STIR coronal and axial images were attempted.

 COMPARISON FILMS:  CT of the chest, [**2118-8-12**].

 FINDINGS:  The examination is severely limited due to patient motion.  The
 examination could not be completed, as the patient could not tolerate holding
 still within the magnet.  The submitted images are severely degraded.  There
 is a right shoulder effusion in the glenohumeral joint.  There is also
 loculated high T2 signal on the STIR sequences over the anterior shoulder and
 anterior to the scapula.  Several rounded low signal focal lesions are present
 within this collection.  There is loss of the glenohumeral space and the
 rotator cuff is not visualized on this study.  Dense bilateral upper lobe
 consolidations are well visualized on the localizer images.  The upper lobe
 consolidations were present on the patient's prior CT.  Given the different
 modalities interval change is difficult to assess but the degree of
 consolidations appear to have likely increased.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extremely limited examination.  The patient could not complete the study
 and the submitted images are degraded by significant motion artifact.  There
 is a loculated high T2 signal collection anterior to the scapula extending
 anterior to the shoulder.  Several round low signal lesions are present in
 this collection.  Findings are nonspecific but most likely represent severe
 glenohumeral degenerative changes with an effusion containing degenerative
 loose bodies. Further evaluation could be made with
  either a dedicated CT through the shoulder or, if the patient clinically
 stabilizes, an attempt at a repeat MR with motion insensitive sequences.
 Correlation with shoulder radiographs is suggested.

 2.  Bilateral upper lobe lung consolidations.

 PROCEDURE:  CT chest.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess resolution/progression of infiltrates post dialysis.

 Comparison is made with prior study CT dated [**2118-8-7**], and chest
 radiographs, most recently [**2118-8-9**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT through the chest without oral or IV contrast. 5
 and 1.25 mm collimation images were reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  There has been a moderate increase in both the extensive perihilar
 ground-glass opacification, peribronchovascular consolidation and more
 peripheral, multifocal, nodular consolidation, most pronounced in the upper
 lobes, right greater than left. No cavitation or bronchiectasis is present. A
 small right pleural effusion is stable while the previous small left pleural
 effusion has resolved.  There is no pneumothorax. The airways are patent up to
 the subsegmental.

 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is normal in caliber. Dense coronary
 calcifications are seen in the LAD and in less extension in the left
 circunflex. The tip of a left subclavian catheter is in the SVC.

 Nearly centimeter-size mediastinal nodes are unchanged.  No enlarged axillary
 or hilar nodes are seen.

 Nonenhanced scans of the upper abdomen show a 12 x 7 mm splenule; the imaged
 portions of the adrenals, liver, pancreas and kidneys are normal.

 Bone windows demonstrate destruction of the anterior cortex of L1 associated
 with left paravertebral soft tissue material attributed to osteoarticular
 infection, but not fully imaged on this study.

 In the right subscapular area three, heterogenous soft tissue masses are
 unchanged. The largest, 33 x 25 mm, contains a coarse calcification. In a
 comparable location on the left is a similar, solitary, but much smaller (11 x
 14 mm) lesion, also with a small calcification.  These lesions are of unknown
 etiology and clinical significance.

 IMPRESSION:  Worsening multilobar pneumonia, much less likely pulmonary

 1.  Tunneled left internal jugular approach dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter
 placement.
 2.  Removal of pre-existent tunneled left internal jugular approach
 hemodialysis catheter.
 3.  Ultrasound-guided venopuncture left internal jugular vein.
 4.  Moderate intravenous sedoanalgesia.

 INDICATION:  Hemodialysis access required.  Prior catheter malfunction.

 OPERATORS:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 22921**], M.D. (fellow).

 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1036**] [**Name8 (MD) 1037**], M.D., (supervising staff) present and supervising the entire
 procedure.

 INFORMED CONSENT:  Procedural informed consent was obtained prior to the
 procedure.

 DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
 procedure to be performed, the site of the procedure, appropriate requisition
 and appropriate informed consent.  Once the above were verified, the patient
 was positioned in supine fashion on a special procedures table.  Left upper
 anterior chest and lower left-sided neck were prepped and draped in usual
 sterile fashion.  Patient arrived the department with pre-existent catheter at
 the left upper anterior chest wall which was also prepped and draped along in
 its exterior course.  Ultrasound was employed to visualize the left internal
 jugular vein.  The left internal jugular vein demonstrated son[**Name (NI) 110**]
 findings of a catheter located centrally within its lumen along the caudal
 course of the left internal jugular vein.  However, there was abnormal
 intraluminal echogenicity surrounding the left internal jugular vein.  The
 left internal jugular vein was also not compressible.

 Utilizing ultrasound guidance, and after the infiltration of the skin,
 uneventful one-walled venopuncture of the low left internal jugular vein was
 performed.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle and
 directed under fluoroscopic visualization to the superior vena cava.  Once
 position was confirmed, the needle was removed and the 3 French/4 French
 dilator-catheter assembly of the micropuncture set was delivered over the
 guidewire and hubbed.  Thereafter, the guidewire was positioned with its tip
 at the atriocaval junction and the intravascular length of the catheter to be
 placed also determined.

 (Cont)

 Subsequently, approximately 15 cc of 1% Xylocaine was used to infiltrate the
 skin and subcutaneous tract and for tunneling of the catheter.  Small
 dermatotomy was made in the left upper anterior chest wall at the access site
 of the catheter.  Subsequently, a 27-cm long AngioDynamics 14.5 French dual-
 lumen hemodialysis catheter was tunneled from the exit incision to the
 venopuncture site.  The latter was expanded with a #11 scalpel blade forming a
 small dermatotomy.  The pre-positioned dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter was
 then released from its retention sutures and removed uneventfully with
 hemostasis achieved promptly using digital compression at the internal jugular
 venopuncture site.  The de [**Last Name (un) 9340**] catheter tract was then serially dilated.  The
 new catheter was then delivered using modified Seldinger technique to the
 level of the cephalad right atrium.  No catheter kinks were seen along the
 course of the catheter.  Both lumens of the catheter were flushed and
 heparinized.  The catheter was sutured in place with using two, 0 silk
 retention sutures.  The catheter was then capped and heparin-locked.  The
 patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was less than 10
 cc.  No complications were encountered.  Post-procedure radiograph
 demonstrates good positioning of the catheter.

 Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after vascular access
 documenting vessel patency.

 MEDICATIONS:  Moderate intravenous sedoanalgesia was administered during the
 course of the procedure along with continuous monitoring of the patient.
 Please refer to nursing flowsheet for dosages.

 The wounds were then closed with occlusive dressing.  Hemostasis was achieved.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post placement of de [**Last Name (un) 9340**] 14.5 French AngioDynamics, 27-cm long
 dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter via left internal jugular approach.
 2.  Status post discontinuation of pre-existent/previous dual-lumen left
 internal jugular approach hemodialysis catheter.
 3.  Peri-catheter thrombosis of the caudal left internal jugular vein.

 INDICATION:  Fever of unknown origin, end-stage renal disease, on
 hemodialysis, evaluate for abscess.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen prior to the
 administration of contrast and followed by axial MDCT images obtained from the
 lung apices to the pubic symphysis following the administration of 130 cc of
 intravenous Optiray.

 CONTRAST:  Oral and intravenous nonionic contrast were administered due to the
 rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are numerous, subcentimeter
 mediastinal lymph nodes not meeting criteria for pathologic enlargement.
 Coronary artery calcifications and probable stent are noted.  There is
 cardiomegaly. The central airways are patent.  Small bilateral low-density
 pleural effusions are present, slightly larger on the right. There are patchy
 bilateral ground glass opacities with several areas of more dense
 consolidation involving the upper lobes and right middle and lower lobes.
 There is no pneumothorax. Nodular- appearing opacities adjacent to the right
 hemidiaphragm may represent pleural plaques.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver
 demonstrates no evidence of masses or biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder
 displays a bilobed configuration with calcified gallstones visualized at the
 fundus, possibly located within a phrygian cap.  The common bile duct is
 nondilated.  The pancreas appears unremarkable.  The spleen is absent.  A
 rounded nodule adjacent to the pancreatic tail (series 3, image 43) may
 represent a splenule.  Right and left adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
 Neither right nor left kidney is identified within the renal fossa.  The large
 and small bowel loops are normal in caliber, and there is no abnormal bowel
 wall thickening.  There is no free fluid or free air within the abdomen and no
 pathologic-appearing mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The
 appendix is normal in caliber and contains oral contrast.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A transplant kidney within the
 right pelvis contains multiple cortical calcifications and demonstrates
 cortical thinning consistent with atrophy.  There is minimal opacification of
                                                             (Over)

 vesicles, and rectum appear unremarkable.  There is diverticulosis of the
 sigmoid colon without evidence of inflammatory change.  There is no free fluid
 or free air within the pelvis and no pathologic-appearing pelvic or inguinal
 lymphadenopathy.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Bone windows demonstrate destruction at the L1-2 level
 consistent with patient's known spondylodiscitis demonstrated on MR [**First Name (Titles) 498**] [**8-4**], [**2118**].  A small amount of paravertebral soft tissue density likely
 corresponds to the phlegmon described on the recent MR.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Osseous destruction at L1-2 with paravertebral soft tissue consistent with
 osteomyelitis/discitis, better demonstrated on recent MR [**First Name (Titles) 498**] [**2118-8-4**].
 Evaluation of the central canal is limited on CT.

 2.  Bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, likely
 representing pulmonary edema, although superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.

 3.  No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.

 4.  Gallstones, without evidence of cholecystitis.

 5.  Absent bilateral native kidneys and atrophic-appearing transplant kidney,

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Colectomy.  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the chest performed without and with the intravenous
 administration of 100 cc of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used due to
 patient debility.  Comparison made to [**2199-2-19**].

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  No pulmonary embolism is seen. The
 heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.  A small pericardial
 effusion is seen.  Bilateral small/moderate pleural effusions have increased
 compared to [**2199-2-19**].  New areas of scattered bilateral ground-glass
 opacities are seen.  Areas of consolidation are also identified in the
 posterior dependent portions of both lower lobes as well as in the anterior
 portions of both upper lobes.  No evidence of thoracic aortic dissection is
 seen.  No pathologically enlarged axillary nodes are seen. Several prominent
 mediastinal lymph nodes are identified that may be reactive in nature.

 In the imaged upper abdomen, limited views of the liver are normal.  The
 patient's known thyroid nodules are incompletely assessed on this examination.

 No bone lesions worrisome for malignancy are identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.

 2.  New areas of ground-glass opacity, septal thickening, and increased
 bilateral small/moderate effusions that suggest pulmonary edema.  Areas of
 opacity suggestive of consolidation are seen in both lungs, a finding that may
 be seen with CHF; however, clinical correlation is suggested to exclude the
 possibility of an infection.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  55-year-old man with posterior mediastinal mass, need
 tissue for diagnosis.  Please rush pathology.

 Comparison made to prior CT dated [**2155-9-4**].

 PROCEDURE:  After the procedure was explained, including risks and potential
 complications, to the patient's wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 102942**], acting as the patient's
 proxy, informed consent was obtained.  A timeout was performed to ensure
 accuracy.

 Patient was placed on the table in a left lateral decubitus position, the most
 satisfactory position that could be achieved on this intubated patient.
 Preprocedure scanning revealed a large posterior mediastinal mass with
 associated vertebral body destruction.  An optimal entry site was identified
 in the posterior chest, just to the right of midline.  The area was cleansed
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was administered
 locally. Utilizing CT guidance, an 18-gauge core biopsy needle was inserted
 into the posterior mediastinal mass, just to the right of the thoracic
 vertebral body and core biopsy specimens were obtained, placed in formalin,
 and hand delivered to the Stat Lab.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.  Post-procedure scanning demonstrated no evidence of
 pneumothorax.

 Staff radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1886**], was present during the procedure.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful CT-guided biopsy of posterior mediastinal mass.

 The right subclavian CV line is in distal SVC.  Endotracheal tube is 4 cm
 above carina.  NG tube is in body of stomach.  No pneumothorax.  The diffuse
 bilateral multilobar pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated with a cavity
 in the right upper lobe.  There is minimal resolution of the consolidation in
 the right upper lobe just superior to the right minor fissure, but otherwise
 little change on the right side.  The left-sided pulmonary opacities are also
 essentially unchanged, though there is now an apparent cut off in the air
 column in the left lower lobe bronchus which could be indicative of increased
 atelectasis at the left base secondary to mucus impaction as the previously

 patient has hemoptysis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT acquisitions of the chest acquired before
 and after administration of intravenous contrast.

 COMPARISON:  Previous CT from [**2152-6-24**].

 REPORT. CT CHEST.

 There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on the current examination.  The
 examination is only of reasonable quality due to respiratory motion.  The
 aorta is calcified.  There is some minimal dilatation of the ascending
 thoracic aorta to approximately 3.8 cm.

 There is bilateral air space consolidation, worse in the right, with some
 associated atelectasis.  In addition to this air space consolidation on the
 right, which involves the right lower and right middle lobe, note is made of
 focal narrowing of the bronchus intermedius.  This likely reflects
 bronchomalacia, as although there is evidence of generalized mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy, none appears to be accounting for the compression.
 Correlation are consideration towards a bronchoscopy may be appropriate.  In
 addition to the above findings, there is some patchy consolidation in the
 right upper lobe which appears nodular in places and metastases are not
 excluded.  Biapical fibrosis, likely reflecting radiation, possibly prior
 granulomatous exposure is seen.  Mediastinal lipomatosis is identified.  There
 is some atelectasis in the left lung base, but this is not as pronounced as on
 the contralateral side.  Interestingly, previous CT showed patchy
 consolidation mostly on the left side but much of this has resolved.  There is
 no significant evidence of left sided bronchomalacia.

 Again identified are multiple expansile destructive metastasis involving the
 upper cervical vertebrae, where there has been laminectomy and placement of
 fiducial seeds for radiotherapy placement.  Despite this, there has been
 progression of the amount of enhancing soft tissue here consistent with
 metastasis.-confluent enhancing soft tisssue of 6 x 4cm is now seen with
 associated vertebral body destruction and rib destruction. Also seen is marked
                                                             (Over)

 angulation-and there is likely instability here. Also identified is extensive
 sternal metastasis, which has progressed from prior examination. There is
 moderate osteomalacia osteopenia identified in many of the remainder of the
 bones and more subtle destructive metastasis cannot be excluded.  Also
 identified in one of the right ribsposteriorly is slightly expansile rib
 lesion which contains some chondroid or osseous matrix, possibly representing
 a focus of fibrous dysplasia or an enchondroma, but not thought to represent a
 metastasis.  This is unchanged from before.

 Below the diaphragm 2 metastasis are identified, one in the dome previously
 seen which is now increased in size and a further in segment 5, not clearly
 appreciated.  The patient appears to be status post left nephrectomy.

 CONCLUSION:

 1)  Right lower and right middle lobe air space consolidation consistent with
 pneumonia.  There appears to be narrowing of the bronchus intermedius.

 2)  Left lower lobe atelectasis and patchy multifocal bilateral generalized
 foci of air space disease most likely reflecting consolidations though
 metastases are not excluded.

 3)  Progression of  osseous vertebral and hepatic metastasis.

 4)  No evidence of PE.

 5)  Possible cervical instability..  Findings were telephoned to and discussed
 with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3563**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 10 a.m. on [**2153-1-23**].

 The patient has had remote median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.  A
 large area of opacification projecting over the right lower hemithorax is
 probably due mostly to a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Vascular congestion is present in the mediastinal and
 to a minimal degree in the lungs suggesting volume overload and or
 biventricular decompensation.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
 pacer leads are continuous from the left axillary pacemaker and unchanged

 TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was done at the bedside in the Hemodialysis
 Unit, and was performed on [**2114-11-3**] at approximately 4 PM. A preprocedure
 timeout was performed. The right chest was prepped and draped in standard
 sterile fashion. The sutures anchoring the tunneled catheter to the skin were
 cut.  The area surrounding the tunnel was infiltrated with approximately 10 cc
 of 1% lidocaine.  Using blunt dissection, the fibrous tissue surrounding the
 catheter was separated, and the catheter was removed. The tip was sent for
 culture.  Approximately 5 minutes of pressure was held over the right internal
 jugular vein.  Hemostasis was achieved. The incision site was covered with a
 sterile dressing and a Tegaderm.  There were no immediate post-procedure
 complications.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no benefit of comparison to the
 previous studies.  The right internal jugular line tip is in mid SVC.  No
 apical pneumothorax is identified but the right costophrenic angle is excluded
 from the field of view.  Thus there is no possibility for total exclusion of
 pneumothorax based on the current chest radiograph.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  The patient has had CABG.  There is left lower lobe consolidation
 which could represent atelectasis secondary to moderate left pleural effusion
 but infectious process cannot be excluded.  The moderate left pleural effusion
 is partially layering obscuring the left lung.  The patient is in mild volume
 overload.  The left-sided pacemaker is inserted with its leads terminating in
 right atrium and right ventricle.  An additional abandoned pacemaker lead is
 present also terminating in right ventricle.  It is unclear if it is connected
 or disconnected to the pacemaker.  For _____ of this finding AP and lateral
 view are recommended.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison is made with a prior chest
 radiograph dated [**2196-6-28**].  The patient is status post CABG with median
 sternotomy.  There is interval placement of cardiac pacemaker with two leads,
 however, the location of these leads cannot be precisely identified on this
 frontal radiograph.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous.  There is mild cardiomegaly.
 Note is made of motion artifact at the lung bases due to respiration.  There
 is increased opacity in bilateral lower lobes especially on the right,
 associated with increased atelectasis and effusion.

 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  Increased opacities in bilateral lower lobes,
 especially on the right with effusion and atelectasis.  Increased vascular
 markings in upper lobes.  These findings can be explained worsening CHF,
 however, there is a possibility of right lower lobe pneumonia.  Please
 correlate clinically.

 COMPARISONS:  [**2155-9-18**].

 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE:  Comparison is also made to a recent chest CT from
 [**2155-9-18**].  The lung volumes are low.  There are bibasilar opacities,
 which may represent atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The tracheal air column is angulated to the left, which could
 relate to rotated positioning. The upper portion of the tracheal air column
 is not well visualized because of overlying structures as well.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Limited study, particularly of the airways and mediastinum.

 2. Bibasilar opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  The possibility of infection cannot be excluded, however.
 Further evaluation with a PA and lateral could be helpful to evaluate further
 if clinically indicated.

 EXAMINATION:  AP chest.

 INDICATION:  Status post left-sided PICC line placement.

 A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2157-10-16**] at 09:20 and is compared
 with the prior radiograph of [**2157-10-13**].  A left-sided PICC line has been placed.
 Its tip appears to overlie the expected location of the proximal SVC.
 Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are not
 significantly changed.  Slight increase in the opacification of the right
 hemithorax compared with the left likely represents layering pleural effusion.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present although this is part
 exaggerated by the low inspiratory effort.  The right-sided bipolar pacemaker
 is in place.

 IMPRESSION:

 Allowing for technical changes and the relatively [**Name2 (NI) 102460**] lungs, the
 findings are likely not significantly changed since the prior radiograph, with
 persistent bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  The left-
 sided PICC line appears to have its tip projected over the expected location
 of the proximal SVC.

 INDICATION:  55-year-old man with new right lower extremity weakness status
 post recent T-spine laminectomy, evaluate for cord compression.

 COMPARISON:  Study from [**2155-9-18**] (CT scan of the chest).

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained of the thoracic spine with
 coronal and sagittal reformatted images.

 CT T-SPINE:  There is marked progression of compression fracture involving the
 T4 and T5 vertebral bodies.  Additionally, there is progression of focal
 kyphosis at that level, with retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal.
 The patient has undergone laminectomy at those levels, however there appears
 to be progression of narrowing at that level, which is severe on this study.
 There is limited evaluation of intraspinal canal contents on CT.  There is
 soft tissue thickening and density posterior to the area of laminectomy, which
 is consistent with post-surgical change.  No definite areas of increased
 density are seen to suggest hemorrhage, though small foci are not excluded on
 this study.  Again seen is soft tissue around the area of compression
 deformity, consistent with the patient's known history of a mediastinal mass
 at that level.

 Extensive degenerative changes are seen at the remaining levels. Additionally,
 there are compression deformities involving the T12 and superior aspect of T11
 vertebral bodies, as seen on prior exams.

 HISTORY:  55-year-old man with multiple myeloma with hypoxia, tachypnea, and
 tachycardia.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector contiguous axial images of the chest were obtained
 prior to and following the administration of intravenous contrast. Reformatted
 images in the coronal and sagittal planes were obtained. Comparison was made
 to the patient's prior T-spine CT study of [**2155-10-15**], and prior chest
 CT study of [**9-18**] and [**2155-8-27**].

 CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are no filling defects in the
 pulmonary arterial vasculature to indicate pulmonary embolism.  Images of the
 lungs demonstrate extensive emphysema.  There are small axillary lymph nodes
 again noted.  Bilateral consolidations are noted, left greater than right,
 raising the question of aspiration in this patient.

 Patient is status post laminectomy of the thoracic vertebral bodies from T1
 through T8.  Compared to the prior study, there has been progression of the
 compression fracture of T4 and T5 vertebral bodies with retropulsion of
 fragments posteriorly into the spinal canal.  For full details, please see
 thoracic CT study of one day prior.  There are postoperative changes extending
 into the mediastinum surrounding the upper thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Progression of thoracic vertebral compression fractures with retropulsion
     of fragments concerning for cord compression.  Neurosurgical service is
     aware of these findings.
 3.  Bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, raise the question of
     aspiration.

 CT CHEST

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up right cavitary lung lesion.

 Comparison is made with prior study dated [**2133-10-20**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT through the chest without oral or IV contrast. 5-
 and 1.25-mm collimation images were reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  40 x 30 mm cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe is unchanged in
 overall size.  The wall is smooth internally, but spiculated externally, and
 varying in thickness from 5 to 12mm.  It contains a 13 mm soft tissue density
 which sits dependently in the cavity. Unchanged are adjacent costal pleural
 thickening and peribronchial infiltration extending to the right hilus which
 becomes inseparable from peribronchial thickening along the right main
 bronchus as far as the carina.

 Interlobular septal thickening and multifocal areas of ground- glass opacities
 are probably due to mild pulmonary edema. A subpleural region of consolidation
 in the lingula is new, and could be atelectasis.

 Small left layering pleural effusion is stable. Multiple paratracheal lymph
 nodes measuring up to 10 mm are unchanged. Central lymphadenopathy extends to
 the subcarinal and upper paraesophageal stations, and right hilar adenopathy
 narrows the anterior semgmental right upper lobe bronchus. There are
 secretions within the trachea, 2:20.

 Multiple healed fractures are unchanged in left lower ribs.

 Mild splenomegaly with splenic infarct is unchanged.  Otherwise, the upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.  There is no ascites in the upper abdomen.

 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.

 Stable right upper lobe cavity suspicious for aspergilloma with.

 Central lymphadenopathy unchanged except for new narrowing of right upper
 lobe, anterior segment bronchus by hilar adenopathy.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison was made with a prior chest
 radiograph dated [**2155-10-18**].  The study is limited due to patient's body
 habitus and positioning.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged
 compared to the prior study, including tortuous aorta.  The evaluation of the
 lung apices are limited due to overlying soft tissue.  Bilateral diaphragm
 appears elevated, however, this can be due to positioning and low inspiratory
 level.  There may be a component of effusion versus bibasilar opacities,
 however, the finding cannot be confidently assessed.

 IMPRESSION:  Extremely limited study due to positioning and body habitus.
 Bibasilar opacities and/or effusion can be present.  Clinical correlation and
 close followup by PA and lateral radiographs is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  56-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on dialysis with
 bacteremia and no growth since the 14th, needing access for hemodialysis.
 Currently, has a temporary catheter requiring tunneled dialysis catheter.

 RADIOLOGITS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 161**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3825**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3825**], the attending
 radiologist, was present and supervising the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was
 placed on the angiographic table in the supine position.  The right neck and
 chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  Based on
 appropriate measurements, a 23 cm, tip to cuff dual lumen dialysis catheter
 was chosen for tunnelled placement.  Approximately 10 cc of 1%
 lidocaine/bicarbonate and 10 cc of 1% lidocaine/epinephrine were used to
 create a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the right lateral supraclavicular
 region to the entry site of the temporary dialysis catheter, which entered
 into the right internal jugular vein.  Using a blunt ended tunneler, the
 tunnnel was created along the anesthetized course and the dialysis catheter
 was pulled through the tunnel, The catheter cuff was inserted approximately 2
 cm above the newly created ""exit""site.

 The old incision site adjacent to the right internal jugular vein was dilated
 with a 14.5-French peel-away sheath under fluoroscopic guidance over a wire.
 The wire and dilator were then removed and the catheter extending from the
 tunnel was advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The peel-away sheath was
 then removed and the line was positioned with tip in the right atrium.  The
 neck incision was then sealed with Dermabond and the line was secured to the
 skin with 2-0 Prolene sutures. An additional suture was placed to seal the new
 incision site.  The line was flushed and heplocked.  The line is ready for
 use.

 Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of fentanyl and
 Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 60 minutes during which the
 patient's hemodynamically parameters were continuously monitored.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large posterior mediastinal mass status post laminectomy.  Query
 hemorrhage at site of recent laminectomy.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest
 after administration of IV contrast, with multiplanar reformats and thin
 section images.

 COMPARISON:  [**2155-9-4**], CT scan.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  In the interval, there has been laminectomy of T1
 though T8, with a posterior vertical surgical staple line, and two drains
 extending from approximately T1 to exit at approximately T9.  There are
 postoperative changes including punctate foci of air in the presumed epidural
 space, and associated stranding in the paravertebral muscles, however, no
 distinct hematoma in the paravertebral area or laminectomy region is
 identified.  The posterior mediastinal mass that was previously reported is
 markedly improved, though there is still some stranding in the posterior
 mediastinum to a maximum of 21 mm in AP dimension (previously 58 mm in AP
 dimension).  A small amount of high-density material is seen in the dependent
 portion of the esophagus at this level, of uncertain clinical significance.
 There is new consolidation and atelectasis in the posterior aspects of both
 lower lobes, which may represent aspiration.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are seen.  There are emphysematous changes of the lungs.

 There is no mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Again noted is a
 right paratracheal/precarinal lymph node measuring 7 mm in short axis
 diameter, likely reactive.

 Limited images of the abdomen are notable for fatty pancreas.  The aorta is
 normal in caliber, with mural calcifications but without dissection.  There is
 no evidence of pulmonary embolism in the central or proximal segmental
 pulmonary arteries.

 There are several compression fractures including complete destruction of T5,
 loss of height of T4, with kyphosis at T4-5 level; also seen are the
 previously described T12 through L3 wedge fractures.  There are marked
 degenerative changes of the spine in the low thoracic region.

 Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings above
 especially of the laminectomy site findings.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Persistent fever, evaluate for pneumonia.

 Comparison is made with the prior chest x-rays.  Heart remains somewhat
 enlarged.  No failure is seen. A retrocardiac density is present on the left
 side which could represent infiltrate or atelectasis.  This was present on the
 prior chest x-ray.  The pleural effusions are somewhat smaller. The
 endotracheal tube now appears somewhat low.  This could be due to the film
 being taken in a lordotic position.

 Some contrast is seen on the left side within the abdomen thought to be within
 the stomach.  Correlation with clinical administration should be made.

 IMPRESSION:  Density behind left heart representing either consolidation or
 atelectasis.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of pleural effusion.

 Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2197-12-18**].

 The heart size is enlarged but stable.  There is marked worsening in bilateral
 perihilar opacities, representing worsening of pulmonary edema which is now
 severe.  In addition, there are new basal consolidations, which may represent
 either pneumonia or aspiration and an underlying atelectasis cannot be
 excluded.  The pleural effusion is bilateral and small, but precise evaluation
 of left pleural effusion is impossible due to the fact that the left
 costophrenic angle is not included in the field of view.

 The right subclavian line tip is in the lower SVC.  The pacemaker leads
 terminate in right atrium and right ventricle.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Marked worsening of pulmonary edema.
 2.  Worsening of bibasilar consolidation, which may be due to an infectious
 process or aspiration.

 midline position overlying the lower neck and full length of the mediastinum.
 New diffuse widening of the cardiomediastinal contour is present.  There is
 also new vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness, and bilateral septal
 thickening.

 In the periphery of the lower left portion of the radiograph, a small opaque
 opacity is present overlying the left lateral rib cage, and could potentially
 represent a foreign body. Although not typical for a retained
 instrument, an additional radiograph to include the entirety of this region
 would be helpful to allow more complete assessment of this region.

 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.  Clinically increasing effusion.

 COMPARISON:  [**2133-10-14**].

 Compared to the prior study, there is improved aeration of both perihilar
 regions.  There is no blunting of the costophrenic angles and I doubt the
 presence of significant-sized pleural effusions.  If there is clinical concern
 for a small pleural effusion, ultrasound may be useful.

 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of both perihilar regions.  No radiographic
 evidence of large pleural effusions.  Clinical correlation is advised.  An
 ultrasound may be useful to identify a small pleural effusion if that would be
 clinically relevant.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  42-year-old woman with cavitary lung lesion in right
 upper lobe, question of left upper lobe cavitary lesion, please evaluate.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images were obtained after the administration of
 intravenous contrast from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen.  Findings
 are compared with prior portable x-ray.

 FINDINGS:  Within the right upper lobe, at the bifurcation of the anterior and
 posterior segments of the upper lobe bronchus, there is a cavitary lesion that
 measures approximately 3.5 x 2.3 cm (in long axis AP by transverse dimension,
 respectively).  Within this cavitary lesion there is a 1.4 cm soft tissue
 nodule, layering dependently.  This cavitary lesion demonstrates spiculated
 margins with retraction of the adjacent pleural surface.  No additional
 cavitary lesions seen.

 Additionally within the lung parenchyma, there are ill-defined hazy opacities
 in the left apex, in the right upper lung abutting the right major fissure,
 and in the right lower lung. There is dense consolidation of the lateral
 segment of the left lower lobe with a moderate sized overlying layering
 pleural effusion.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrate old fractures of the left
 posterior sixth through tenth ribs.  No other osseous lesions are seen.

 Evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrate a moderate amount of ascites
 surrounding the liver and spleen.  In addition, there is a wedge-shaped low
 density area abutting the splenic capsule, compatible with a splenic infarct.
 Gallstones are incidentally noted within an unremarkable gallbladder.  The
 liver demonstrates a nodular surface and is likely cirrhotic.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cavitary lesion at the right upper lung with soft tissue density seen
 within it.  While this may represent a mycetoma within an old benign cavity, a
 cancerous lesion cannot be excluded and correlation with direct tissue
 sampling is recommended.  No additional cavities seen.
 2.  Diffuse hazy opacities throughout the lungs may represent infection or
 hemorrhage.
 3. Splenic infarct.  Recommend echo to assess for cardiac origin of emboli.

 INDICATION:  42-year-old woman with cirrhosis, status post thoracentesis, now
 with acute hematocrit drop.  Question bleed.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen, [**2133-10-17**] and CT chest, [**2133-10-16**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast-enhanced axial CT images of the thorax, abdomen, and
 pelvis were obtained.

 CT OF THE THORAX WITH IV CONTRAST:  The soft tissue windows reveal no
 pathologically enlarged axillary lymph nodes.  Paratracheal and subcarinal
 lymph nodes are identified, the largest of which measures up to 9 mm and while
 not technically meeting the strict criteria for pathologic enlargement, likely
 represent reactive nodes.  Although difficult to fully evaluate without
 contrast, the visualized portions of the heart, pericardium, and great vessels
 are unremarkable.  A small left-sided pleural effusion is identified which
 shows interval decrease compared to the previous study.

 Lung windows again reveal cavitary lesion within the right upper lobe.  The
 cavity itself measures approximately 2.3 x 1.9 cm and contains an
 approximately 1.3 cm soft tissue density which sits dependently within the
 cavity.  Surrounding the cavity, spiculated opacification is identified.  Of
 note, there has been interval development of airspace disease and ground glass
 changes around this cavitary lesion concerning for endobronchial spread of
 disease.  Endobronchial thickening is noted with a potential small nodular
 component.  Adjacent to this lesion, an area of wedge-shaped pleural
 thickening and potential retraction is identified.  Right middle lobe airspace
 disease and ground glass changes are also evident.  Hazy opacities near the
 left lung apex appear unchanged compared to the previous study.

 The airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Although evaluation is limited by lack
 of contrast, the liver appears unremarkable.  The gallbladder again
 demonstrates stones within its lumen, the largest of which measures
 approximately 15 mm.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys show no
 obvious abnormalities.  Evaluation of the small and large bowel is limited by
 lack of oral contrast; however, no obvious deformities are present.  Scattered
 mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified, none of which are
 pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.  Ascites and fluid infiltration of
                                                             (Over)

 mesentary is again evident and appears overall unchanged compared to the study
 on [**10-17**].

 Although evaluation of the previously identified splenic infarct is difficult
 secondary to lack of contrast, no obvious changes in appearance are
 identified.  Of note, an collection of increased attenuation conforming to the
 posterior aspect of the spleen is identified on today's study.  It is
 difficult to assess if this was present on the previous study secondary to
 differences in technique.  This finding is concerning for the presence of
 blood behind the posterior aspect of the spleen and may be consistent with
 subcapsular hematoma of the spleen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, uterus, and
 bladder show no obvious abnormalities.  The ovaries are noted to be floating
 within the free pelvic fluid identified.  In the dependent portion of this
 pelvic fluid, there appears to be a layering level of higher attenuation
 consistent with a hematocrit level suggesting a small amount of
 hemoperitoneum.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified.

 Osseous structures reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Although technically difficult to fully assess the interval change due to
 the lack of contrast on today's study, interval development of high
 attenuation collection around posterior aspect of spleen as well as dependent
 heme level within the free fluid of the pelvis worrisome for a small amount of
 hemoperitoneum and subcapsular splenic hematoma.
 2.  Right upper lobe cavitary lesion with intraluminal soft tissue nodule.
 Although malignancy is within the differential, interval development of
 surrounding airspace disease and ground glass changes suggest bronchial spread
 of an infection.  The appearance suggests reactivation TB; however, pyogenic
 infection should also be considered.  Reactive lymph nodes identified within
 the mediastinum.
 3.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

 These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8216**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34704**] at approximately 3:30 on

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2118-7-25**]

 COMPARISON:  [**2118-7-24**].

 INDICATION:  Fever.  Possible right upper lobe pneumonia.

 The recently described right upper lobe opacity is no longer evident, but
 there are new patchy opacities at both lung bases and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The basilar lung opacities are most likely due to atelectasis, but
 aspiration is an additional consideration in the appropriate clinical setting.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the chest were obtained without and
 with IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.

 CTA CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arteries are patent
 without evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.  There is
 mild cardiomegaly.  A right subclavian central venous catheter is noted with
 the tip in the distal SVC.  Note is made of a calcified prevascular lymph
 node.  There are ground-glass opacities and interstitial infiltrates
 predominantly involving the right upper lobe.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted, including loculated fluid within the right minor and major fissures.
 There is a small axial hiatal hernia.  Numerous stones are noted within the
 gallbladder.  There is fullness of both adrenal glands.  A small amount of
 ascites is observed. A gastrostomy tube is in good position.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No PE.
 2.  Interstitial infiltrates and ground-glass opacities predominantly
 involving the right upper lobe.  This could represent asymmetric pulmonary
 edema, however, aspiration or developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There
 is cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Cholelithiasis.
 4.  Small amount of ascites.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest lateral decubitus.

 INDICATION:  Pneumonia versus CHF versus pulmonary edema.  History of
 tachycardia and known right-sided opacity on chest examination this morning.

 FINDINGS:  Two left side down decubitus films of the chest have been obtained.
 There is evidence of a small approximately half to one centimeter layering
 pleural effusion on the dependent left side.  The focus of interest relates to
 the right-sided chest density which was poorly explained on the conventional
 upright portable film in particular as a chest CT did not demonstrate
 significant free abdominal air collection.  Both left-sided decubitus films
 show in the non-dependent right-sided chest a density in the mid portion which
 is compatible with some pleural effusions in the minor fissure gravitating to
 the mediastinal side of the pleural space.  At no point in the normally
 aerated upper lobe and lower lobe area is there evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 most likely explanation is an atelectasis in the right middle lobe area
 coinciding with some moderate amount of pleural effusion gravitating in
 relation to patient's position.  No evidence of pneumothorax exists on this
 decubitus examination.

 HISTORY: 42-year-old female with cirrhosis status post fall this morning, now
 with head and neck pain, concern for fracture or malalignment.

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the cervical spine.

 FINDINGS:  The skull base through upper T2 vertebra are well visualized. There
 is no prevertebral soft tissue abnormality. There is 3- mm, grade I- II
 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5, which is age indeterminate. A disc-osteophyte
 comple at this level causes mild ventral narrowing of the spinal canal.  No
 definite associated hematoma or fracture is identified. There are mild
 multilevel facet degenerative changes most notable at C4/5 on the right. A
 small disc protrusion at C5/6 also mildly narrows the ventral spinal canal.

 Incompletely evaluated on this study are the large, approximately 3.5- cm
 cavitary lesion of the right lung apex, as well as scattered patchy opacities
 at both lung apices and a moderate left pleural effusion.  These are better
 characterized on the chest CT from two days ago.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  3-mm, grade I to II anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 is age-indeterminate.
 But no fracture is identified, and this likely relates to significant
 right more than left facet arthropathy.
 2.  3.5-cm right apical cavitary lesion concerning for mycetoma or possible
 malignancy, scattered patchy apical opacities, and moderate left pleural
 effusion; these findings are better evaluated on Chest CT from 2 days ago.

 The results of this study were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1755**] at 9:30 a.m. on

 HISTORY:  42-year-old woman with right lung mass, ARDS, and hemoptysis.
 Evaluate for interval change.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**2133-10-2**].

 There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 1.6 cm above the carina and
 could be pulled back approximately 2 cm for more optimal placement.  There is
 a right-sided central venous catheter with the distal tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.  There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and sideport are below the
 gastroesophageal junction.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within
 normal limits.  There is again seen a 3-cm cavitary lesion with surrounding
 increased density in the right upper lobe.  This is unchanged from previous.
 There has been persistent improvement of the pulmonary edema since the
 previous study.  There is a focal area of small consolidation within the right
 base which is unchanged and may represent asymmetric resolving edema.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Persistent pulmonary edema which is slightly improved.

 2.  A cavitary lesion within the right upper lobe.  Again further evaluation
 with CT scan is recommended once the patient's acute symptoms have improved.

 COMPARISON:  [**2163-5-31**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
 obtained without contrast.  IV contrast could not be administered due to the
 patient's newly elevated creatinine of 2.3.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted
 images were generated.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are small axillary lymph nodes
 bilaterally, not meeting CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
 Evaluation of lymph nodes of the mediastinum is limited without IV contrast.
 There are coronary artery calcifications.  The aorta is not dilated.  The
 presence or absence of aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism cannot be
 assessed without IV contrast.  There are diffuse nodular and coalescing patchy
 opacities throughout the right lung, predominantly in the upper and lower
 lobes and to a lesser degree within the left upper lobe.  The findings are
 consistent with pneumonia.  Atypical pneumonias are considered.  The central
 airways are patent.  No pleural or pericardial effusions.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Evaluation of the abdominal organs is
 limited without contrast, but the noncontrast appearance of the liver,
 gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands is normal.  There is no
 hydronephrosis.  The stomach, small and large bowel are normal in appearance.
 No free air or free fluid in the abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes, though there are scattered small
 lymph nodes at these locales.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter within the
 bladder, and air within the bladder likely related to instrumentation.  There
 is also a right femoral venous catheter in place.  The tip is located within
 the left common iliac vessel.  The prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum, and

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Extremely limited exam given the lack of IV contrast.  The presence or
 absence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection cannot be assessed.

 2.  Multiple nodular patchy and confluent opacities within the lungs, greatest
 in the upper lobes.  Atypical infections are considered. Additional history
 of HIV was obtained. PCP pneumonia and other opportunistic infections are
 considered. A component of edema is likely also present as the patient
 received aggressive fluid rescusitation.

 3.  Coronary artery calcifications.

 The findings were relayed to the ED dashboard at the immediate conclusion of
 the exam.

 UPRIGHT AP CHEST:  A pacemaker overlies the right chest, with leads overlying
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  There are low lung volumes, and
 respiratory motion is evident.  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is seen coursing
 along the right chest and through the right upper abdomen, terminating beyond
 the radiograph.  There are aortic arch calcifications.  The patient's chin
 over lies the upper chest, and the most superior portion of the mediastinum.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, moderate in
 amount.  There is associated compressive atelectasis.  An underlying
 consolidation, particularly on the right side is not excluded.  There is no
 evidence of congestive failure.

 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
 with associated atelectasis.  A lower lobe pneumonia, particularly on the
 right, cannot be excluded.  If indicated, a PA and lateral view of the chest
 could be considered.

 Rotated positioning.  As a result, it is somewhat difficult to identify the
 precise site of carina.  However, the ET tube lies in satisfactory position
 above the carina, probably approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip beneath diaphragm.  A right subclavian central line is
 present, tip overlying the right atrium.  There is upper zone redistribution.
 There is patchy opacity throughout much of the right lung and in the
 retrocardiac region.  This most likely reflects the presence of CHF, but the
 possibility of an associated infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  55-year-old man with mediastinal mass.

 COMPARISONS:  Not available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT images of the abdomen were first obtained
 followed by CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous
 contrast.  After a three-minute delay, additional imaging through the level of
 the kidneys only was also performed.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions of
 the torso were also performed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large heterogeneous soft tissue
 mass in the posterior mediastinum, abutting the carina, partly encasing a
 segment of the descending aorta, and surrounding the anterior vertebral
 bodies, at the levels of T4 through T6. Much of it is relatively
 hypoattenuating, although not of fluid density. There are small foci of air
 within the mass, perhaps cavitation.

 At the upper margin of the mass, the esophageal air column disappears, and
 distally beyond the mass, the gastroesophageal junction appears normal and
 contains a small amount of air.

 There are multiple distinct enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes elsewhere in
 addition to the confluent mass. The heart, great vessels, and pericardium are
 unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion.  A small right-sided pleural
 effusion is present, trace on the left only.  There are bibasilar opacities,
 which are most suggestive of atelectasis. There is marked emphysema
 peripherally, but no definite lung mass.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Evaluation of the abdomen is somewhat
 limited in that there is streak artifact due to the arms lying at the
 patient's side.  No focal liver lesions are identified.  There may be a small
 amount of sludge in an otherwise normal-appearing gallbladder, which is not
 distended.  The pancreas is atrophic.  There is some stranding in the vicinity
 of the pancreas, although not necessarily focused on the pancreas.

 (Cont)
 Slight stranding also involves the mesenteric root and is nonspecific.  Slight
 thickening of the left pararenal fascia.

 The spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands appear normal. The stomach, small and
 large bowel are not dilated and contrast passes through to the cecum.  Distal
 loops of small bowel do contain fluid. There is a small fat containing left-
 sided ventral hernia. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
 lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are prostate calcifications.  The
 bladder appears normal.  Sigmoid diverticulosis is noted.  There is no pelvic
 sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  There is a left-sided fat-containing
 inguinal hernia.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Multiple
 lower thoracic compression fractures are noted.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large heterogeneous posterior mediastinal mass, abutting the carina from
 its posterior aspect, and involving the aorta and the spine. The mass is
 probably accessible to bronchoscopic biopsy if clinically indicated.

 The differential diagnosis is broad, in that the appearance is not entirely
 typical for any single process. It may represent a primary lung or esophageal
 cancer, or perhaps lymphoma. Infection cannot be excluded, however, although
 the bony structures appear intact, arguing again epidural abscess. An MR could
 be helpful to exclude this diagnosis if clinically indicated. Bacterial or
 tuberculous infection is also possible, the latter perhaps less likely due to
 the lack of evidence for it elsewhere.

 2.  Severe emphysema.

 3.  Bibasilar opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis.

 4.  Probable involvement of the esophagus by the mass.

 5.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

 6.  Vague stranding about the mesentery and pancreatic regions.  This
 appearance is nonspecific.  It does not appear to focus distinctly on the
 pancreas, but it may be helpful to correlate with pancreatic enzymes.

 7.  Multiple lower thoracic and lumbar compression fractures.

 INDICATION:  65-year-old male status post Dobbhoff feeding tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  [**2176-9-24**].

 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is again visualized with its tip projecting 2
 cm above the carina.  The endotracheal tube cuff is overinflateed.  Low lung
 volumes.  Linear opacities in the left lung base likely represent subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Diffuse right upper lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis.
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  There is widening of the mediastinum
 that could be due to vascular engorgement; however, if mediastinal hematoma is
 suspected, CT could be obtained.  An OJ tube is seen and appears to be coiled
 upon itself.  Interval placement of a  Dobbhoff tube with its tip projecting
 in the gastric cavity, 4 cm below the GE junction, advancement is recommended
 for optimal position. No evidence of pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tip of the ETT projecting 2 cm over the carina.  Repositioning is
 recommended.

 2.  Overdistended cuff of the endotracheal tube.

 3.  OJ tube looped upon itself, repositioning is recommended.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 SKULL RADIOGRAPHS, TWO VIEWS:  The patient has a ventricular drainage
 catheter.  There is a tiny linear density of uncertain etiology overlying the
 right frontal region, which is only seen on the AP view, and may represent
 something outside of the body.  No other foreign bodies are identified.  The
 paranasal sinuses are well aerated.  There is a nasogastric tube within the
 stomach, with the weighted tip positioned within the distal stomach.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is atelectasis at the left lung base.  There is
 suggestion of a small pleural effusion on the left, or pleural scarring.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.

 ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPH:  A Dobbhoff tube is seen within the stomach.  Contrast
 can be seen within the colon from a prior study.  There are contour
 abnormalities involving the pubic rami bilaterally, suggesting prior trauma.
 Degenerative changes are seen within the hip joints.  No fracture is seen.  No
 metallic foreign bodies are identified.

 AP CHEST 4:12 a.m. on [**9-28**].

 HISTORY:  Intubation.

 IMPRESSION:  AP view of the chest read in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs.

 Large region of homogenous opacification involves the lateral [**3-13**] of the right
 lung, extending from the ribs to consolidation projecting over the right hilus
 predominantly in the right lower lobe.  Overall findings suggest substantial
 pneumonia, but there could be a large mass in the periphery of the right
 upper lobe. Right hilus is obscured by pulmonary abnormality superiorly, but
 appears elarged and lobulated inferiorly; adenopathy is suspected. Left lung,
 left hilus and the mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is not enlarged,
 and there is little if any pleural effusion.

 ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements.

 Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the time of
 dictation.

 Portable chest x-ray for line placement, [**2176-10-2**] at 1348 hours.

 HISTORY:  Line placement.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2176-10-1**].

 FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, there has been interval
 placement of a right upper extremity PICC line which extends into the right
 neck with the distal tip not visualized.  This needs to be repositioned.  Lung
 volumes are further diminished.  There is right middle lobe subsegmental
 atelectasis.  An indistinct opacity is noted at the left lung base, likely
 atelectasis as well.  The diminished lung volumes distort the mediastinal
 contours.  There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta.  Cardiac silhouette size
 is stable.  Again noted is an enteric feeding tube with the distal tip in the
 pylorus.  This positioning is stable.  There is a focal levoconcave curvature
 of the upper thoracic spine, again stable relative to prior studies.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Inappropriate placement of PICC line with distal tip extending cephalad.
 This needs repositioning.  This information was relayed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
 referring physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the time of dictation.

 2.  Enteric feeding tube is in inappropriate position for enteric feeds.  If
 line does not advance, consider fluoroscopic guidance in Radiology.

 3.  Worsening lung volumes with increasing right middle lobe atelectasis.

 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.

 The patient is markedly kyphotic.  There is cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, with more confluent alveolar
 opacities at both bases.  The right hemidiaphragm is obscured and it is
 difficult to determine whether the lucency seen at the right base is within
 the lung itself or beneath the diaphragm.

 Two tubes overlie the mediastinum, both extending beneath the diaphragm. These
 presumably represent NG type tubes, but clinical correlation is requested.  A
 right subclavian central line is present, the tip is not well visualized but
 likely overlies the distal SVC. The bowel gas pattern, although unusual is
 similar to that seen on [**2128-8-21**] and there has been an interval abdominal CT
 for evaluation.  Please see report from the abdominal CT.

 IMPRESSION:  Probable CHF.  The possibility of an underlying infiltrate cannot
 be excluded.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is new compared
 with [**2128-8-21**] and the opacity at the right base is  worse.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2119-5-24**] AT 13:17 HOURS

 HISTORY:  Oxygenation desaturation post-intubation.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated earlier the same day.

 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is positioned slightly low with the distal
 tip approximately 1.9 cm from the carina.  A left subclavian approach central
 line remains stable in course and position with the tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.  A nasogastric tube is appropriately positioned.  The right lung
 remains relatively clear with large opacity at the right hilum again noted.
 There is significant left lower lobe atelectasis to presumed complete collapse
 and a moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  The left upper lobe is less
 aerated than on the prior examination.  Evaluation of the left upper lobe,
 however, is significantly limited due to overlying respiratory and other
 devices.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old female with chronic respiratory failure, acute
 onset hypoxia out of proportion to radiograph and bronchoscopy findings.
 Evaluate for pulmonary embolus.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced MDCT acquired axial images of
 the chest from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen.  Multiplanar
 reconstructed images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  No filling defect is identified within the pulmonary arteries to
 suggest pulmonary embolus.  The thoracic aorta maintains a normal contour
 without evidence of dissection.  Mild atherosclerotic calcification is seen
 within the aorta.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  No pericardial is
 appreciated. Bilateral subsegmental dependent atelectasis is identified.
 Furthermore, there is small bilateral effusions, diffuse bilateral ground-
 glass opacity and septal thickening consistent with interstitial edema.
 Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, the largest of which
 measure 1.5 cm in the right peritracheal station.  No axillary lymphadenopathy
 is appreciated.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.  Patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen
 throughout the thoracic spine.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a hiatal hernia as well as a
 percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tube.

 HISTORY:  Acute desaturation.  Following bronchoscopy.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest.  Following tracheal extubation, left lower lobe
 collapse and small left pleural effusion are unchanged.  There is greater
 distention of mediastinal vasculature, but only mild edema in the left lung.
 Small right infrahilar opacity is localized atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette
 is partially obscured by left pleural effusion but not grossly enlarged.  Tip
 of the left subclavian line projects over the superior cavoatrial junction and
 a nasogastric tube passes to the mid stomach.  Increased caliber to the
 mediastinum reflects increased intravascular volume due to a cessation of
 positive pressure ventilation support.

 A new, 2.5 cm wide round opacity at the periphery of the right mid lung,
 warrants surveillance to exclude pulmonary infection or infarction.  Dr.

 HISTORY:  Aspiration yesterday.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2179-5-9**], 06:49 p.m.

 Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung has worsened
 slightly, partially obscuring a more discrete 5-cm wide opacity seen on
 yesterday's study that could be a cavitated mass.  Large lung volumes
 generally suggest COPD.  Mild interstitial edema is new.  Heterogeneous
 opacification at the left base could be more residua of aspiration or
 atelectasis.  High density flocculent material projecting over the left
 diaphragmatic pleural surface could be aspirated barium or pleural
 calcifications.

 A stent device is present in the upper abdominal midline.

 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous from
 the left axillary pacemaker.  No pneumothorax.  Findings were discussed by
 telephone with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1200**] at the time of dictation.

 coronary bypass surgery and pacemaker insertion.

 Comparison is made to prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2155-4-22**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the chest without
 intravenous or oral contrast.  5 mm, 2.5 mm, and coronal reformatted images
 were evaluated.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST

 FINDINGS:

 There is a moderate sized, simple, non-hemmorhagic, right pleural effusion
 tracking into the major fissure with associated compressive atelectasis of a
 large portion of the right lower lobe.  A small, simple, left effusion a small
 pericardial effusion are also present.  The airways are patent to the
 subsegmental level. There is a 3 mm soft tissue pulmonary nodule in the
 anterior right upper lobe (4:125) and mild biapical scarring and septal
 thickening within the apices (left greater than right), likely interstitial
 edema. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes but
 several mediastinal nodes are enlarged, up to 1.4 cm in short axis in the
 subcarinal and left paratracheal stations.

 Atherosclerotic calcification in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries, as
 well as mitral annular calcification, is heavy. A left-sided dual lead
 pacemaker is present and cardiomgaly is unchnaged.

 Limited examination of the upper abdomen displays calcification within the
 intra-abdominal aorta, splenic vessels, and hepatic artery, but is otherwise
 unremarkable. No malignant bone lesions are identified.  Degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine and old left 7th and 8th rib fractures are present.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Moderate, layering, nonhemorrhagic, right pleural effusion responsible for
 substantial right lower lobe atelectasis.  Small left pleural and pericardial
 effusion. Mild interstitial edema.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST dated [**2179-5-10**]

 INDICATION:  Concern for aspiration.  Right lower lobe abnormality on chest
 radiograph.

 Multidetector CT of the chest was performed following intravenous
 administration of 100 cc of Optiray.  Images are presented for display in the
 axial plane at 5 mm and 1.25 mm collimation.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of cavitary mass within the right lower lobe
 to account for the suspected abnormality on recent chest radiograph.
 Multifocal areas of patchy consolidation are present predominantly in the
 dependent portions of the right upper lobe and both lower lobes with
 additional scattered areas of abnormality in the remaining portions of the
 lungs.  These findings are superimposed upon diffuse bilateral septal
 thickening and centrilobular ground glass opacities.  Thickening of the
 bronchovascular structures is also noted particularly in the lower lobes.
 Within the left lower lobe, high attenuation material is present adjacent to
 the bronchovascular bundles with attenuation suggestive of aspirated oral
 contrast such as barium.  Scattered centrilobular peribronchiolar nodular
 opacities are identified bilaterally.  Additionally, three discrete 3-4 mm
 diameter right upper lobe nodules are identified (images 69, 77 and 92 of
 series 4).  Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are present, the vast majority
 measuring under 1 cm in short axis dimension, although a confluence of nodes
 in the left lower paratracheal region measure greater than 1 cm.  Bilateral
 mild hilar lymphadenopathy is also present, and there are small dependent
 pleural effusions.  Note is made of prior median sternotomy and coronary
 bypass surgery.  The heart size is normal.  Diffuse coronary artery and aortic
 valvular calcifications are present.  Small hiatal hernia is noted.

 In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the adrenal glands are normal.
 Graft is present within the abdominal aorta, but is incompletely imaged on
 this study which was not specifically tailored to evaluate the abdominal
 organs.  Several large collateral vessels are present within the left lateral
 chest wall.  Left subclavian and left brachiocephalic veins appear narrowed.

 consolidation likely mimicked a mass on recent chest radiograph.

 2.  Multifocal consolidation and bronchiolitis, most pronounced in the
 dependent portions of the right upper and both lower lobes, likely due to an
 acute aspiration pneumonia.  High attenuation material within the left lower
 lobe is suggestive of aspirated barium or other oral contrast.

 3.  Diffuse septal thickening and ground-glass attenuation likely reflects
 coexisting hydrostatic pulmonary edema.

 4.  Mediastinal and hilar nodes, likely reactive in the setting of presumed
 acute infection.

 5.  Three noncalcified right upper lobe lung nodules, statistically most
 likely benign as incidental findings.  If warranted clinically, followup chest
 CT could be performed in six months to ensure resolution of the pneumonia and
 lymph nodes and to evaluate for stability of the small lung nodules.

 6.  Numerous collateral vessels in the left chest wall and axilla as well as
 apparent narrowing of the left subclavian and brachiocephalic veins.
 Considering indwelling permanent pacemaker, this may be due to a longstanding
 vascular stenosis.

 HISTORY:  71-year-old woman with shortness of breath; evaluate for CHF.

 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP examination labeled ""upright at 8:45 a.m."" is compared
 with two views obtained one day earlier; allowing for technical differences,
 the overall appearance is not much changed.  There is persistent cardiomegaly
 with slight interstitial edema and small-moderate right and small left pleural
 effusions, with basilar atelectasis.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with mitral valve surgery and CABG, and a left-sided pacemaker has
 lead tips projected over the RA and RV apex (in this single view).  No focal
 consolidation is seen.

 IMPRESSION:  No short-interval change in appearance of CHF with right greater
 than left effusions.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  Status post tracheal decannulation, evaluate for interval change.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a
 similar preceding study obtained approximately 14 hours earlier during the
 same date.  The previously described tracheostomy cannula remains in place.
 The increased interstitial pattern has progressed diffusely in both lungs and
 is compatible with interstitial edema.  The further extension now also into
 the alveolar spaces is suggestive of pre-edema status.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax nor is there any local infiltrate suggestive of local
 inflammatory process.  The lateral pleural sinuses remain free, but some
 pleural effusion in the posterior pleural sinuses can of course not be
 excluded on this single AP chest view.

 IMPRESSION:  Increasing interstitial pattern compatible with increasing
 pulmonary congestion.  As before, the patient is status post previous
 sternotomy and bypass surgery.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY

 INDICATION:  89-year-old male with ""aspiration event"" yesterday.  Assess for
 pneumonia.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There are multiple foci of increased density within the left lower
 lobe along the medial border.  Query - could these be from a previous barium
 examination during which the patient aspirated.  There are several areas of
 linear atelectasis at the left lower lung base.  There are a few, ill-defined
 small opacities within the right mid and right lower lungs respectively. These
 could be consistent with a history of aspiration.  The heart size is enlarged.
 Postoperative finding is consistent with CABG.  There are multiple median
 sternotomy wires overlying the midline of the thorax.  Silhouette of a stent
 device presumably within the abdominal aorta is also seen.  A dual-chamber
 pacemaker is incompletely imaged on this examination.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear aside from the findings described above.

 IMPRESSION:  Multiple punctate hyperdensities at the left lower lung base
 could represent aspiration from previous barium administration.  Please
 correlate with patient's history.  Several ill-defined opacities in the right
 mid and right lower lung could represent underlying aspiration.  A repeat PA
 and lateral chest x-ray is recommended.

 COMPARISON:  [**2139-2-22**].

 INDICATION:  Toxic shock.

 Left PICC line has been withdrawn slightly and is now in the proximal superior
 vena cava.  Heart size is normal.  Bilateral lower lobe consolidation has
 slightly improved.  Multiple poorly defined nodular opacities in the upper mid
 lung regions are slightly more prominent than on prior radiograph but may be
 better visualized due to PA rather than portable technique.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left are unchanged, allowing
 for positional differences.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight improvement in bilateral lower lobe consolidation.  Persistent
 poorly defined nodules.  These findings are consistent with multifocal
 infection.
 2.  Persistent pleural effusions, right greater than left.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  40-year-old male with group A strep shock, gram-positive
 ascitic fluid.  Patient still with fevers.  Evaluate pleural effusion and sign
 of loculation.

 COMPARISON:  [**2139-2-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced multidetector acquired CT images of the chest,
 abdomen and pelvis from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.  Coronal
 and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

 CT OF THE CHEST:  Again seen are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusion and
 adjacent compressive atelectasis.  Multiple bilateral nodular opacities are
 seen throughout the lungs. Given history of endocarditis, this finding is
 concerning for septic emboli.  Multiple lymph nodes are seen within the
 mediastinum, the largest of which  measures approximately 9 mm in the right
 paratracheal station.  No pericardial effusion is seen. Heart and great
 vessels are otherwise unremarkable.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A low-density lesion is again
 seen in the left lobe of the liver, likely representing a cyst.  A 10 x 8 mm
 enhancing lesion is seen within the caudate lobe of the liver corresponding to
 the hemangioma noted on previous CT and ultrasound.  No new lesions are
 identified.  The gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys are
 within normal limits.  There is mild bowel wall thickening of the cecum, which
 may be secondary to an infectious or inflammatory etiology.  There is trace
 fluid within the abdomen.  No intra-abdominal free air is detected.  The
 previously identified low-density retroperitoneal lymph node along the right
 para-aortic region at the level of the kidneys is unchanged.  Small mesenteric
 lymph nodes are present, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologically
 enlarged.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon,
 intrapelvic loops of small bowel, bladder, distal ureters, and prostate are
 normal.  A Foley catheter is seen within a decompressed bladder.  Trace
 intrapelvic free fluid is evident.  No pathologically enlarged inguinal or
 pelvic lymph nodes are identified.

 than left, remain present, perhaps slightly improved on the left.  Mild
 bilateral pulmonary vascular engorgement remains noticeable.

 CONCLUSION:  Interval partial pullback of the endotracheal tube, with its tip
 now at the level of the medial ends of the clavicles, 6 cm above the carina.
 Possible minimal improvement of the left basilar pleural effusion.  Otherwise
 unchanged.

 interstitial markings.  No new focal consolidations are seen.  Cardiomegaly
 persists, and ETT remains in place.  There is an NGT with the tip extending
 below the confines of the film, but clearly below the left hemidiaphragm.

 IMPRESSION:  Improving CHF with some persistence.

 HISTORY:  CHF, CAD, and SOB.

 AP BEDSIDE CHEST.  The heart is enlarged with previous sternotomy and apparent
 CABG.  ET and NG tubes are satisfactorily positioned (tip of NG tube not
 visualized).  No overt vascular congestion and no consolidations.  Equivocal
 subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.  I doubt the presence of effusions.
 Since exam one day previous, the vascular congestion and layering pleural
 effusions have improved and possibly resolved.  Lungs remain well inflated and
 I suspect this patient has underlying emphysema.

 IMPRESSION:  Short interval improvement/resolution of CHF.

 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF [**2147-5-2**].

 COMPARISON:  [**2147-4-30**].

 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.

 Right PICC line has been placed and has an unusual course.  After entering the
 expected location of the right subclavian vein, it makes an abrupt upward turn
 at the junction of the middle and medial third of the clavicle, and
 subsequently courses laterally within the right supraclavicular soft tissues.
 Precise location is uncertain but is likely within a branch vessel.  This
 finding has been communicated by telephone with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2304**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2305**], IV therapy
 nurse caring for this patient.

 Heart size is normal, and lungs are clear except for discoid atelectasis at
 the left lung base.

 Comparisons available from the prior study done on [**2155-4-30**].

 SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 Since the prior study there has been interval placement of the right-sided
 Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip projecting in the main pulmonary artery.  The
 endotracheal tube tip is projecting at least 5 cm above the carina, in
 satisfactory position.  The NG tube side-port projecs within the stomach.  The
 right-sided chest tube is in the proper position.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are mildly enlarged which is not an uncommon finding after recent
 surgery.  Note is made of bibasilar increased opacities suggestive of
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Increased interstitial markings likely pulmonary
 edema.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post placement of endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, NG tube
 and right-sided chest tube in proper position.
 2.  Mild enlargement in the size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette which is
 not an uncommon finding after recent thoracic surgery and is suggestive of
 postsurgical changes.
 3.  Increased interstitial markings reaching the lung periphery suggestive of
 pulmonary edema.

 INDICATION:  61-year-old male with peripheral vascular disease requiring IV
 access for antibiotics.

 A PICC line was advanced by the PICC nurse but was incorrect position in the
 post-procedure chest radiograph.  Please reposition.

 RADIOLOGIST:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1807**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**].  Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 7**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure
 supervising.

 PROCEDURE:  A spot fluoroscopic image was obtained and demonstrates that the
 tip of the line was in the neck.  The right arm was then prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was provided with 3 cc of 1%
 lidocaine.  Attempt was done to reposition the catheter without success.  We
 could not advance the catheter centrally. Approximately 5 cc of non-ionic IV
 contrast were injected demonstrating that the catheter was in cephalic vein.
 There was opacification of the axillary and vein and marked peripheral
 subclavian vein with complete obstruction of the subclavian vein.  We then
 decided to leave the catheter within the subclavian vein with the tip in the
 subclavian vein.  The catheter was then repositioned under fluoroscopy.  The
 tip was in the subclavian vein and was confirmed with the injection of 1 cc of
 IV contrast.  Patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Repositioning of single lumen PICC line.  The tip was left in the
 subclavian vein.
 2.  Complete occlusion of the right subclavian vein.  We were unable to
 advance the catheter centrally.

 INDICATION:  39-year-old man with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma on previous
 biopsy.  Now with thrombocytopenia, hematuria, and epistaxis.  Please evaluate
 for lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was
 performed after oral and intravenous contrast.  Non-contrast images of the
 abdomen and delayed images of the kidneys as well as coronal and sagittal
 reformations were obtained.

 CT OF THE CHEST:  There is extensive bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, with
 the largest nodes measuring 4.8 x 2.9 cm in the left axilla, and 3.1 x 2.2 cm
 in the right axilla.  There is a borderline lymph node measuring 8 mm in the
 right hilum.  8 mm paratracheal lymph node is also seen.  The heart,
 pericardium, and great vessels appear unremarkable.

 There is a 4 mm pulmonary nodule in the right major fissure, in between the
 right upper and right lower lobes (3:26).  There are several subpleural
 nodules adjacent to the spine, which more inferiorly become retrocrural lymph
 nodes, these measure up to 11 mm in short axis.

 The density of the blood compared to the left ventricular wall is consistent
 with marked anemia.  There is no pleural effusion.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  There is a 6 mm hypodensity in the posterior right lobe of
 the liver 3:55 as well as an 8 mm hypodensity in the spleen (3:56).  The
 gallbladder, adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys, and bowel appear normal. There
 are multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes particularly in the para-
 aortic region measuring up to 2 cm in short axis.  The major vascular
 structures are patent and of normal caliber.  There is no ascites or free
 intraperitoneal air.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:  The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum, and pelvic
 loops of bowel appear normal.  A clip is seen in the right lower quadrant.
 Bilateral enlarged lymph nodes are seen along the common and external iliac
 chains, these measure up to 15 mm in short axis bilaterally.  There is no free
 fluid in the pelvis.  Some superficial subcutaneous stranding in the region of
 the left flank with foci of subcutaneous air, likely represents an injection

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma, status post
 tracheostomy and internal jugular clots, necrotic lymphadenopathy and
 pseudomonal pneumonia.

 There are no prior studies for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained following
 the administration of 80 mL of Optiray contrast, and displayed at 5 and 1.25
 mm collimation.  Coronal reformatted images were generated.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are large conglomerates of necrotic
 lymph nodes in the supraclavicular regions bilaterally, of fluid attenuation
 centrally and enhancing peripherally.  The imaged portion of the right
 supraclavicular conglomerate measures up to 8.1 x 4.9 cm in greatest axial
 dimensions, the left 10.1 x 5.1 cm.  Both internal jugular veins are occluded.
 The subclavian veins are not identified.  The left brachiocephalic vein
 opacifies with contrast as it crosses the aortic arch, but cannot be
 identified cephalad to this point.  The right brachiocephalic vein is not well
 visualized.  There are extensive collateral vessels within the posterior and
 anterior chest.

 A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is simple in attenuation, with a
 significant component located within the lower major fissure.  The left
 pleural effusion is small and simple in attenuation.  Atelectasis is seen
 adjacent to both pleural effusions; the right lower lobe has completely
 collapsed.  Lung windows demonstrate marked parenchymal opacification within
 the upper lobes, that could, given the appropriate historn, be due to
 radiation.  Ground-glass opacities are seen throughout the lungs more
 inferiorly, with more confluent opacity within the inferior right upper lobe.
 All the ground- glass opacities are nonspecific and may represent edema or
 infection, the confluent opacity of the inferior right upper lobe, likely
 represents pneumonia.  The central airways remain patent, with a tracheostomy
 tube at the thoracic inlet.

 The heart size is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.  There are
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch.  Several enlarged axillary
 nodes are seen bilaterally measuring up to 1.6 cm in the short axis dimension.
 Several borderline mediastinal nodes are seen, measuring 8-10 mm in the short
 axis in the paratracheal station, and 12 mm in short axis in the subcarinal

 station.

 The exam was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  A tiny hypodensity
 of the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize.  Subcutaneous
 edema is evident in the chest and upper abdomen.

 There are no definite bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extensive necrotic lymphadenopathy of the supraclavicular region, with
 apparent occlusion of both internal jugular and subclavian veins.
 2.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion,
 with associated atelectasis involving the entire right lower lobe.
 3.  Biapical opacities may reflect radiation treatment if there is such a
 history.
 4.  Ground-glass opacities throughout the remainder of the lungs are
 nonspecific, possibly reflecting edema or infection.  A more focal opacity in
 the lower right upper lobe suggests pneumonia.
 5.  Axillary lymphadenopathy and borderline mediastinal nodes.
 6.  Extensive subcutaneous edema.

 internal jugular clots greater on the right than the left, and necrotic neck
 lymphadenopathy.  Please evaluate mass and extent of clot burden.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from same day.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the neck after administration of 80
 cc Optiray intravenous contrast.

 FINDINGS:  There is massive cervical lymphadenopathy throughout the neck
 bilaterally, displacing and distorting normal tissue planes.  Majority of the
 lymphadenopathy demonstrates low-attenuation center, consistent with necrosis.
 Large conglomerate lymph nodes have completely occluded the right internal
 jugular vein, and narrow and likely occlude the left internal jugular vein at
 the level of the thyroid cartilage.

 There is a large amount of retropharyngeal fluid, which could possibly relate
 to lymphatic obstruction due to lymphadenopathy.

 Evaluation of the lung apices demonstrates bilateral pleural effusion, and
 parenchymal opacities, which are more completely evaluated and described on
 concurrently performed CT of the chest.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Massive bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, with low-attenuation centers
 consistent with necrosis.
 2.  Complete occlusion of the right internal jugular vein, secondary to
 compression from lymphadenopathy, and at least partial, and possibly complete
 occlusion of the left internal jugular vein at the level of the thyroid
 cartilage from similar compression.
 3.  Retropharyngeal fluid collection, possibly secondary to lymphatic
 obstruction, v. inflammatory process.
 4.  Biapical pleural fluid, and parenchymal opacity, described in detail on
 separate chest CT report.

 INDICATION:  55-year-old man with sigmoid colectomy 2 weeks ago, now with
 fever and an elevated white blood cell count.  In addition, the patient is
 tachycardic and hypoxic.

 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest x-ray from [**2110-7-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed with CTA
 protocol, followed by CTE protocol of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and
 intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reformations were obtained.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  The opacification of the pulmonary arteries is suboptimal.
 However, there appear to be filling defects bilaterally in the segmental
 branches, with some secondary signs such as enlargement of the vessel, for
 example in the segmental right lower lobe artery (3:45).  The heart, and in
 particular the right ventricle, is not enlarged.  There is no pericardial
 effusion. The thoracic aorta is of normal caliber.  The central airways appear
 patent. The right lower lobe segmental bronchi may have mucoid impaction and
 are not well visualized.

 In the lungs, there is extensive ground glass opacity involving the right
 lower lobe, with areas which are more consolidative.  In addition, there is a
 moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  A 5-mm rounded ground-glass opacity is
 seen in the right middle lobe (3:50) and another 4-mm in the right upper lobe
 (3:7) . In the left lower lobe, there is an ovoid opacity adjacent to the
 pleural surface posteriorly (3:72) and measuring roughly 1.9 cm.  Minor
 emphysematous changes are seen in the upper lobes.

 No pathologic lymphadenopathy is identified in the chest, there are small AP
 window lymph nodes not measuring about 6 mm.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas,
 and kidneys appear normal.  There is mild dilation of loops of mid small
 bowel, with more distal small bowel decompression.  The colon demonstrates
 good contrast opacification, and has a normal appearance.  There is mild
 stranding and postoperative change in the anterior abdominal wall in the
 anterior mesentery consistent with recent sigmoid colectomy.  A colonic
 anastomosis is seen in the left lower quadrant consistent with that history.
 There is no pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The
 abdominal aorta is of normal caliber with mild atherosclerotic calcification.
 There is no free fluid demonstrated in the abdomen.  No ascites is noted.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:  The kidneys, bladder, ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles,
 and rectum appear normal.  There is a very small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis.  There is no pathologic pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 Osseous structures demonstrate post-operative change at L5 consistent with
 bilateral laminectomies and mature fusion.  There is grade I anterolisthesis
 of L4 on L5 with degenerative end plate changes at L3, the inferior endplate
 of L4 and superior endplate L5 and superior endplate.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Acute pulmonary embolism with no CT evidence of associated right heart
 strain.
 2.  Extensive ground-glass opacity with more focal areas of consolidation in
 the right lower lobe along with a moderate right-sided pleural effusion.
 Aspiration, atelectasis, infection, or possible infarct from embolism are in
 the differential.
 3.  5-mm right middle lobe ground glass nodule, 4-mm right upper lobe nodule,
 and 1.9- cm peripheral left lower lobe consolidative opacity.
 4.  Right lower lobe segmental bronchi obstructed - consider aspiration,
 mucoid impaction.  Bronchoscopy could be considered if findings do not resolve
 over time, once more acute issues are dealt with, as this can be a cause of
 fever and leukocytosis.
 4.  Mildly dilated loops of mid small bowel distally decompressed small bowel.
 Contrast passes freely into the normal-appearing colon.  Findings are
 suggestive of ileus.  Early or partial small-bowel obstruction cannot be
 entirely excluded but is felt not likely.

 CHEST SINGLE VIEW ON [**6-14**] AT 6:15.

 HISTORY:  Right PICC.

 FINDINGS:  There is a new right PICC with tip just past the axilla and the
 subclavian vein although it is pointed downward.  This finding was called to a
 house staff at the time of dictating this report on [**6-14**] at 8:45.  The
 right-sided effusion has markedly decreased with improved aeration on the
 right and continued alveolar infiltrate bilaterally that has increased on the
 left.  It is unclear if this is all due to pulmonary edema or an underlying
 infectious infiltrate.  There continues to be a moderate right effusion that
 is layering posteriorly.  However, this is much smaller than on the prior
 study.

 AP CHEST, 5:16 A.M., [**2111-6-16**].

 HISTORY:  Supraglottic carcinoma, cervical adenopathy, pneumonia, and
 neutropenia.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-14**] through 16:

 Large right pleural effusion continues to increase at the expense of aeration
 in the right lung and mediastinal shift to the left.  Moderately-severe
 pulmonary edema has worsened.  Mild cardiomegaly is new.  Mediastinal vascular
 engorgement and/or adenopathy produce stable mediastinal widening in the
 region of the aorta and right paratracheal stations.  Tracheostomy tube in
 standard placement.  No pneumothorax.  Right PIC catheter ends in right
 axilla.

 HISTORY:  Check location of PICC line.  Check progression of disease.

 FINDINGS:  Again seen is the PICC line that extends just past the axilla into
 the subclavian vein and then goes downward.  Again seen is a large right
 pleural effusion and bilateral alveolar infiltrates, right greater than left
 with volume loss in both lower lobes.  An underlying infectious infiltrate
 cannot be excluded, although many of these changes are likely due to fluid
 overload.

 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The right lower hemithorax is not included
 in the examination.  Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position.  Diffuse
 opacification of the right lung remains relatively unchanged as is the large
 right pleural effusion.  Continued opacity involving the left upper and mid
 lung is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified on this limited examination.

 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in diffuse opacification of the right lung
 and ill-defined opacities in the left upper and mid lung, likely representing
 multifocal pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion, unchanged.

 REFERENCE EXAM:  [**6-13**]

 FINDINGS:  There continues to be a large right effusion but it is slightly
 decreased in size and there is better aeration of the right lung.  There are
 alveolar opacities in the right lung that could be due to incomplete re-
 expansion versus some alveolar infiltrates.  There is hazy vasculature on the
 left suggesting an element of fluid overload.  There continues to be widening
 of the paratracheal stripe on the right which is felt to be secondary to fluid
 and volume loss.  Tracheostomy tube is in good location.

 COMPARISON:  [**2111-6-17**].

 SUPINE AP CHEST:  A tracheostomy is in place, with the tip 7.3 cm from the
 carina.  Right pleural fluid is increasing in volume compared to recent
 preceding exams noted particularly at the apex and lateral right chest.
 Increased density within the right hemithorax is related to the increasing
 effusion as well.  Diffuse pulmonary vascular congestion is persistent.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, with evidence of mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.  No pneumothorax is evident.  There is persistent elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm.

 INDICATION:  Back pain and abdominal surgery and leukocytosis.

 Two views of the chest were compared to [**2110-7-17**] and demonstrate
 decreased lung volumes.  Opacity at the right base may represent atelectasis
 versus infection. Perihilar haze is largely explained by crowded vasculature
 secondary to low lung volumes though mild fluid overload may be partially
 responsible. Multiple small bowel air-fluid levels are present within the
 visualized abdomen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right lower lobe opacities, atelectasis versus infection.
 2.  Low lung volumes and crowded pulmonary vasculature, superimposed mild
 vascular congestion is possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION FOR THE EXAM:  This is a 61-year-old man with supraglottic SCC.  IV
 access needed for medications.  The procedure was explained to the patient.  A
 timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3001**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 166**] performed the procedure.  Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 412**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervised the entire
 procedure.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, various attempts to puncture the
 vein were done under direct ultrasound guidance.  Basilic vein was first
 attempted unsuccessfully due to stenosis distally confirmed after a venogram
 was obtained. Some collateral veins were also attempted unsuccessfully.  The
 cephalic vein was also punctured and after unseuccesful advancement of
 guidewire, a venogram was performed and showed distal stenosis with collateral
 veins and without visualization of the central venous system. Peelaway sheath
 was then placed over the guidewire and a 10-cm double lumen PICC line was
 placed through the peelaway sheath. Unfortunately, flushing was possible but
 aspiration was not possible from either of the lumen. The PICC line was then
 exchanged to a single lumen, again measuring 10 cm in length with its tip
 positioned in midline position of the cephalic vein using flouroscopic
 guidance. The position of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest. The peelaway sheath and guidewire were then removed. The
 catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied. The
 patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.
 Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access
 documenting vessel patency.

 IMPRESSION:  Ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single-lumen line
 placement via the left cephalic venous approach.  Final internal length is 10
 cm, with the tip positioned midline in cephalic vein, due to venous occlusion.
 The line is ready to use.

 COMPARISON:  AP semi-upright view of the chest from 5:50, the same day.

 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Tracheostomy tube is present with tip in
 standard position, 7.3 cm from the carina.  Study is limited by
 respiratory motion artifact.  Allowing for this, the diffuse opacity involving
 the right lung has progressed, appearing more consolidative in nature,
 with increased loss of aeration.  A large right pleural effusion has also
 increased in the interval. Continued heterogeneous opacity primarily involving
 the left upper and mid lung is not significantly changed in the interval.
 Small left pleural effusion is likely present.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Standard positioning of tracheostomy tube.

 2.  Worsening diffuse opacification of the right lung with increased size of
 large right pleural effusion.

 3.  Unchanged heterogeneous opacity in the left upper and mid lung and small
 left pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CTA chest.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  56-year-old man with shortness of breath, history of
 stroke.  Rule out pulmonary embolism.

 No prior CT study is available.  Limited comparison made to prior chest
 radiographs, the most recent dated [**2120-4-26**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple transaxial images of the chest were obtained with and
 without intravenous contrast, utilizing the pulmonary embolism protocol.
 Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were also obtained.

 CHEST:  The pulmonary artery is normal in size and appearance.  No
 intraluminal filling defects are seen in the main pulmonary artery or its
 proximal branches.  The aorta is normal in size and caliber without evidence
 of aneurysm or dissection.

 There are multiple, focal patchy regions of air space disease predominantly
 involving the apices, especially the right upper lobe.  There are bilateral
 pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left representing
 compressive atelectasis.  No pulmonary nodules are identified.  No pericardial
 effusions.

 There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.

 There are prominent right hilar lymph nodes.  No left hilar, mediastinal or
 axillary lymphadenopathy.

 Limited images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

 Findings were discussed with resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 145**] [**Name (STitle) 17546**].

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Multifocal, patchy air space disease.  Findings nonspecific but
 differential diagnosis includes infectious or inflammatory process, including
 cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.  While this is an atypical distribution for
 aspiration, given the patient's clinical history, this would also be a
 consideration.

 technical differences, there does not appear to have been any significant
 change in the appearances of the chest with bilateral pleural effusions.
 Increased density in the retrocardiac area on the left side may be a
 reflection of pleural effusion together with superimposed atelectasis/airspace

 otherwise unchanged since the prior examination with likely bilateral pleural
 effusions, more marked on the right side.  Increased density in the left
 retrocardiac area may be secondary to atelectasis/airspace disease.  Residual
 barium contrast is seen in colon in the left upper quadrant.

 IMPRESSION:

 Stable appearance of the chest with bilateral pleural effusions. Right IJ line
 with the tip at the cavoatrial junction or just inside the right atrium. This

 INDICATION:  Pneumonia. Access for IV antibiotics.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3743**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3744**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1292**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1624**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1624**], the
 attending radiologist, was present and supervising for the duration of the
 procedure.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography
 table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm the patient's identity
 and type of procedure to be performed.  Ultrasound was used to identify the
 right brachial vein which was patent and compressible.  The right arm was
 prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  After injection of 2 mL
 of 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was advanced under ultrasound guidance into
 the right brachial vein.  Hard copy ultrasounds were obtained before and after
 venous access documenting patency.  A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced
 through the needle to the distal SVC.  The needle was exchanged for 4.5-French
 micropuncture sheath.  A 4-French single lumen PICC was then advanced through
 the sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the distal SVC.  The peel-away
 sheath and wire were removed.  A final fluoroscopic image of the chest
 demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be in the distal SVC.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure
 complications.  The catheter was flushed and StatLocked in appropriate
 position.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 4-French PICC via the right brachial
 vein with the tip in the distal SVC.  The line is ready for use.

 a dilated segment of small bowel in the right lower abdominal quadrant
 appearing to  terminate in a larger collection of barium in the right abdomen
 where one would expect the transverse colon.  The remainder of the abdomen is
 relatively gasless.  At very least upright studies are needed to outline loops
 of bowel and determine the extent of distention.  It may be necessary to do
 either a fistulogram or a contrast study per rectum to delineate the anatomy.
 One cannot exclude free intraperitoneal air on supine views alone.  The
 enterostomy tube projects over the left upper quadrant, probably a
 gastrostomy.

 As compared to the last film from yesterday at 10:12 a.m., there has been
 slight interval advancement of the tracheostomy tube, with its tip now at the
 level of the medial ends of the clavicles.  The right-sided PICC line remains
 in similar position, with its tip at the level of the central portion of the
 superior vena cava.  The small right apical pneumothorax remains barely
 visible and is smaller than yesterday.  Focal opacity at the periphery of the
 mid right lung field is again noted which likely corresponds to the prior
 chest tube insertion site.  There has been slight interval increase of opacity
 at the left lung base, consistent with some worsening of the left basilar
 pleural effusion.  Heart size remains normal.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  64-year-old woman with hypoxia and cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for
 PE.

 TECHNIQUE:  CTA with and without contrast.  Multiplanar reformations were
 performed.

 COMPARISONS:  No prior chest CTs are available for comparison purposes.

 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided approximately 25% anterior pneumothorax.
 There is no evidence of tension pneumothorax.  There are very severe diffuse
 centrilobular emphysematous changes throughout both lungs, most severe in the
 upper lobes.  There are multiple large bullae, mostly in the periphery of the
 upper lobes.  The patient is intubated, the airways are patent to the
 subsegmental bronchi level.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels appear
 unremarkable.  No pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are
 seen.  There is no central PE.  There is an incomplete filling defect in a
 subsegmental branch of the right lower lobe.  There are mild dependent
 atelectatic changes, no effusions or consolidations are seen.  Images through
 the upper abdomen demonstrate a G-tube and no acute pathology.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Anterior wedging, likely degenerative in nature, of several mid
 thoracic vertebral bodies are seen.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci are
 seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right-sided anterior pneumothorax, approximately 25%.  No evidence of
 tension pneumothorax.

 2.  Severe centrilobular emphysematous changes throughout both lungs.

 3.  Incomplete right lower lobe subsegmental PE, of uncertain clinical
 significance.

 The pertinent findings have been discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 53**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 2:25 a.m. on
 [**2128-3-20**] and flagged to the ED dashboard.

  Very large non-enhancing filling defect within the right atrium consistent
  with history of IVC thrombus extending into the right atrium. This measures
  nearly 4 x 7 cm. Contrast appears to flow around this filling defect into the
  right ventricle and there is no evidence of pulmonary embolus. Lungs are
  clear.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pulmonary embolus and IVC thrombus/tumor.  Please
 evaluate for pulmonary embolus.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images were first obtained through the chest
 without contrast with a low-dose technique, followed by contrast-enhanced CT
 angiogram of the chest.  Coronal, sagittal, and oblique sagittal reformatted
 images were obtained.

 CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Again seen
 is a massively dilated inferior vena cava containing a large non-enhancing
 filling defect, which extends into the right atrium.  This has not
 significantly changed since the CT torso of [**2101-12-19**].  However, comparison is
 difficult secondary to different technique.  There is no evidence of mass or
 thrombus in the right ventricle or pulmonary arteries.  There is no pulmonary
 embolus. Probable contrast mixing defect in SVC. The aorta is normal in
 caliber throughout. The coronary arteries are normal.  There is no pericardial
 effusion.  The airways are patent to the segmental level bilaterally.  There
 is unchanged probable scarring in the anterior segment of the right upper
 lobe.  Dependent changes are seen in the lung fields bilaterally.  There are
 no nodules or areas of airspace consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion.
 There is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy. Although this examination is not tailored evaluation of the
 abdominal organs, limited images through the upper abdomen show unremarkable
 portions of the spleen and kidneys.  The liver shows a small amount of biliary
 air and metallic clips within the gallbladder fossa.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

 CT REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial
 findings.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large, nonenhancing filling defect within the IVC extending into the right
 atrium measuring up to 4 x 7 cm, which has not significantly changed in size

 INDICATION:  49-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer and left pleural
 effusion.

 No comparison is available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
 abdomen after administration of the Optiray intravenously.  No oral contrast
 was administered.  Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were then obtained.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  No filling defect is noted within the main pulmonary artery
 and its branches to suggest pulmonary embolism. However evaluation of the
 subsegmental braches is limited due to atelectasis. The heart has normal
 appearance. No pericardial effusion is noted. No pathologically enlarged
 central lymphadenopathy including mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes
 are visualized. Moderate to severe left malignant pleural effusion is noted.
 Thyroid contains a nodule in the right lobe.

 The lung windows demonstrate complete collapse of the left lower lobe and the
 inferior part of the lingula.  The right lung is clear with no focal
 consolidation, pulmonary nodule or parenchymal opacification.  Minor
 atelectatic changes are noted at the right lung base.

 The visualized portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates normal appearance of
 the liver, spleen, and the left adrenal gland appears normal.  Moderate amount
 of ascites is noted within the abdomen.  Incidental note is also made of
 omental caking within the anterior abdomen.

 BONE WINDOWS:  The bone windows do not demonstrate any concerning lytic or
 sclerotic lesions.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine is
 visualized.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No pulmonary embolism. Evaluation of the subsegmental branches of the left
 lower lung is limited due to lung collapse.

 extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  No gross effusion
 is identified. No pneumothorax detected.

 Compared with [**2101-12-10**] and allowing for differences in technique, there has
 probably been some re-expansion of atelectasis in the right lung. Otherwise, I

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2101-12-2**]

 Comparison is made with prior study from [**2094-4-2**].

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old man with hypothermic, unknown past medical
 history, evaluate for pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Patient is
 slightly rotated to his right, limiting evaluation.  The lungs appear clear
 bilaterally and there is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess due to
 technique, but allowing for these differences appears grossly stable from
 prior study.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous
 structures are intact.  Degenerative changes are noted in the spine.

 IMPRESSION:

 Limited study demonstrating no evidence of CHF or pneumonia.

 INDICATION:  Coronary artery disease.  Preoperative assessment.

 Examination is technically limited due to exclusion of the extreme right lung
 base laterally from the radiograph.

 Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  The ascending and descending aorta
 are tortuous.  The imaged portions of the lungs are clear, but repeat
 radiograph to include the excluded portion of the right lung base laterally is
 recommended to allow complete assessment of the lungs and pleura.  This view
 could be repeated at no additional charge to the patient.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**2-4**], the patient has undergone a
 CABG procedure.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina.  Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the proximal portion of the
 right pulmonary artery.  Mediastinal drains are noted and a left chest tube is
 in place without pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach.


 There is some indistinctness of the pulmonary markings especially in the left
 perihilar area consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 Increased opacification at the left base is consistent with postoperative
 atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:  Standard appearance following CABG.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Esophagogastrectomy with shortness of breath.

 Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is new, could be due to atelectasis.
 Pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions
 are unchanged.  Distal atelectasis in the left base is stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  Right subclavian
 catheter remains in place with the tip in the right atrium.

 IMPRESSION:  New left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity.  Compared to prior
 study of [**2101-1-15**], this could be due to atelectasis, but pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.

 INDICATION:  65-year-old man with history of CAD and COPD with hypoxic event
 perioperatively.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

 No comparison studies.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained without IV
 contrast with low-dose during expiration.  IV contrast enhanced images of the
 chest were obtained per the non-gated chest pain protocol.  Multiplanar
 reformations were obtained.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is intubated with tube
 terminating at the thoracic inlet, approximately 7 cm above the carina. There
 is no evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection,
 or aneurysmal dilatation. There are multiple scattered lymph nodes throughout
 the mediastinum and hilum, none of which appear pathologically enlarged. There
 are extensive coronary artery calcifications. The heart is mildly enlarged.
 There is no pericardial effusion. The central airways are patent. Evaluation
 of the subesegmental branches is limited due to atelectasis and bolus timing.

 There is bilateral lower lobe air-space consolidation more compatible with
 atelectasis. The lateral right lung is excluded from the contrast- enhanced
 imaging. There are no pleural effusions.

 Limited views of the abdomen demonstrate a small amount of perihepatic fluid.
 Gynecomastia is noted.

 Osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism in central or segmental branches.
 Limited evaluation of the subsegmental branches due to bolus timing.
 2.  Bilateral lower lobe airspace consolidation likely representing
 atelectasis.
 3.  Small perihepatic fluid.
 4.  ETT at the thoracic inlet. Advancement is recommended.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Follow-up of a patient after esophagectomy.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to preoperative study from [**2101-1-6**].

 The ETT tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip terminates at the
 regular location of the gastroesophageal junction.  The right subclavian line
 tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  The bilateral chest tubes are shown, the
 right one terminating in the right apex and the left tip being located in the
 left posterior pleural space.  The post-surgical drain is in the left upper
 mediastinum.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable for post-
 surgical stage.  The bibasilar lower retrocardiac atelectasis are noted, most
 likely explained by relatively low lung volumes.

 Small left apical and lateral pneumothorax is demonstrated with possible basal
 component.  Small amount of left subcutaneous emphysema is noted.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1186**] at the time of dictation over phone by

 A single AP view of the chest is obtained portably in semi-upright on [**2158-10-28**]
 at 06:44 hours and is compared with the most recent study performed on
 [**2157-1-12**].  The heart is not enlarged.  There is moderate tortuosity of the

 of the interstitium.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, more marked on
 the left side.  More confluent density is seen in the right lower lung field
 adjacent to the heart which may represent superimposed airspace disease.
 Evaluation of the skeletal structures shows deformity of the right humeral
 head.

 IMPRESSION:

 Given the recent transfusion of blood and fluid, the findings likely represent
 fluid overload/early failure.  The more confluent density in the right lower
 lung field may represent superimposed airspace disease/aspiration and followup
 is recommended.  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3551**] at 1:55 p.m.

 EXAMINATION:  AP chest.

 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, wheezing.

 Single AP view of the chest was obtained [**2158-10-29**] at 03:06 hours and compared
 with the previous morning's radiograph performed at 06:44 hours.  No
 significant adverse interval change is noted.  Again is seen diffuse increase
 in the interstitial markings bilaterally together with more focal opacity
 adjacent to the right heart border.  Likely bilateral pleural effusions.
 Marked degenerative changes seen in the right glenohumeral joint.

 IMPRESSION:

 Findings likely represent early interstitial edema/fluid overload with
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Area adjacent to the right heart border may
 represent superimposed infection.

 CHEST.

 HISTORY:   CAD, CABG, chest tube removal.

 One portable view.  Comparison with [**2108-11-16**].  There is streaky density at the
 lung bases consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as before.  A left chest
 tube has been removed and there is slight interval increase in a very small
 left apical pneumothorax.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 CABG as before.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged.  An endotracheal tube,
 nasogastric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter and mediastinal drain have been removed.
 The costophrenic sulci now appear blunted, which may reflect the presence of
 small pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in left pneumothorax and interval appearance of
 small pleural effusions post-removal of line and tubes.

 INDICATION: IV access needed for medications and fluids.

 The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 7**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**], the
 Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 45 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under
 fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured
 to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided double lumen
 PICC line placement via the right basilic venous approach. Final internal
 length is 45 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

 EXAMINATION:  AP chest.

 INDICATION:  Persistent dyspnea.

 A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2180-10-21**] at 0918 hours and
 compared with a prior radiograph performed on [**2180-10-29**].  There is a persistent
 congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.  The left-sided
 pleural effusion is likely increased since the prior examination.  That on the
 right side is stable.  Right-sided PICC line has been inserted and its tip is
 projected over the mid SVC.  Left-sided pacemaker/ICD device unchanged in
 position.  Increased retrocardiac density on the left side likely represents
 superimposed atelectasis/airspace disease of the left base.

 IMPRESSION:

 Persistent congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions which
 appear to have increased on the left side.

 possible pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest views are analyzed in direct comparison with
 the next preceding similar chest examination of [**2150-7-13**].  During the
 latest examination interval, all instruments have been removed, and there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax or new parenchymal infiltrates.  A thin linear
 plate atelectasis remains on the left base and corresponds to similar changes
 in the posterior area including some mild blunting of the posterior pleural
 sinus.  The heart size remains significantly enlarged and so does the
 generally widened and elongated thoracic aorta.  Three small metallic
 components of a [**Company **] valve are identified in the aortic valve area.

 Observe that the image of the frontal view is wrongly marked left to right.
 Direct comparison with the next previous study, however, confirms appropriate
 situs.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax, left lower lobe retrocardiac
 atelectasis, and small amount of pleural effusion remaining.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.

 INDICATION:  Status post bypass surgery.  Evaluate left-sided effusion.

 FINDINGS:  The present PA and lateral chest views are analyzed in direct
 comparison with the preoperative chest examination of [**2150-7-1**].  There is
 now status post sternotomy and the 3 tiny circular metallic structures of a
 [**Company **] aortic valve prosthesis are identified in appropriate location in
 both PA and lateral views.  The heart is enlarged, slightly more than on the
 preoperative examination, but the configuration is unaltered.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion; however, bilaterally there remain pleural
 effusions blunting the lateral pleural sinuses, slightly more on the right
 than the left.  They are seen to extend in the posterior pleural sinuses
 bilaterally as identified on the lateral views.  Also, the visibility of the
 minor and major pleural pulmonary fissures is noted on the bases.  There
 remains a crowded vascularity in the posterior lower lobe segment, but this is
 slightly less marked than on the next previous portable postoperative chest
 examination of [**7-14**].  No new parenchymal infiltrates are identified.

 IMPRESSION:  Increased heart size in comparison with preoperative examination
 but stable on followup.  No evidence of pulmonary congestion or new
 infiltrates, but remaining small amounts of bilateral effusions.  Further
 follow up is recommended.

 INDICATION FOR EXAM:  61-year-old man with SCC needs PICC for chemotherapy.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 22239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 44**], [**Doctor Last Name **] and [**Doctor Last Name 65**] performed the procedure. Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 65**], the Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire
 procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access. A guidewire was now advanced over the right
 subclavian vein and venogram with injection of a contrast was obtained.
 Venogram demonstrated occlusion of right subclavian vein with multiple
 collateral veins.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guidewire and 5
 French single lumen PICC line measuring 19 cm in length was then placed
 through the peel-away sheath with its tip in the mid axillary vein under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  The position of catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic film over the chest.  The peel- away sheath and the guidewire
 were then removed.  The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed and a
 sterile dressing applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well. There
 were no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited venogram of the right upper extremity shows complete occlusion of
 the right subclavian vein with multiple collaterals.
 2.  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopic guided 5 French single lumen
 PICC line placement by right basilic venous approach. Final internal length is
 19 cm, with the tip positioned in right mid axillary vein. The line is ready
 to use.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The spine is visualized from the skull base
 through T2.  There is straightening of the cervical lordosis which could be
 due to the collar.  No malalignment or fracture is seen.  There is no pre-
 vertebral soft tissue swelling.  The patient is intubated and an NG tube is
 present.  There is a gunshot entry wound in the left lung apex with a
 consolidation and/or hematoma.  Multiple radiopaque fragments are seen in this
 location likely representing fragments from the bullet.  There is subcutaneous
 emphysema tracking along the left neck and shoulder musculature. A left-sided
 chest tube terminates at the left lung apex.  The distribution of metallic
 particles near the left lung apex in a linear fashion suggests a bullet
 trajectory from left anterolateral to posteromedial or vice versa.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No fracture or dislocation.
 2.  Gunshot injury to the left upper chest with hemorrhage in the left lung
 apex, bullet fragments traversing the left apex and large subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is better evaluated on the subsequently acquired contrast
 enhanced torso CT.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  19-year-old male status post multiple gunshot wounds to the
 chest and abdomen.  Evaluate for acute traumatic injury.

 FINDINGS:  Supine portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Underlying trauma
 board is noted limiting evaluation.  An endotracheal tube is noted with its
 tip approximately 2.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is seen with its tip in
 the stomach.  Increased opacity is noted in the left upper lung concerning for
 hemorrhage/contusion in the setting of gunshot wound.  There is air outlining
 the left cardiophrenic recess, may represent pneumothorax.  There appears to
 be aeration of the lingula and left lower lobe.  The right lung appears
 unremarkable. Heart size appears within normal limits. Mediastinal contour is
 difficult to assess given the subjacent consolidation. There is no deviation
 of the NG tube.  No definite fractures are identified on this study, though
 further evaluation with CT is strongly advised.  No free air is noted below
 the diaphragm.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET and NG tube in appropriate positions.
 2.  Opacity in the left upper lung is concerning for hemorrhage/contusion in
 the setting of trauma.  Adjacent bullet fragments are noted.
 3.  Evidence of pneumothorax on the supine radiograph with air outlining of
 the left cardiophrenic recess.  No evidence of tension.

 Correlation with CT is strongly advised.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2119-5-29**].  The heart size is
 difficult to assess due to presence of bilateral pleural effusions and
 expiratory technique of the film.  The patient is rotated but the overall
 appearance of mediastinum is unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The
 lung apices are obscured by the patient head.  Repeated radiograph with
 appropriate patient positioning is recommended.

 Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2162-11-2**].

 The ET tube tip is 4.2 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular line
 tip is in mid SVC.  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely
 terminating in the stomach.  There is overall slight left deviation of the
 course of the NG tube from expected, most likely related to scoliosis.  There
 is worsening of left retrocardiac opacity most likely consistent with
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumonia or appreciable pleural effusion although
 small pleural fluid cannot be excluded.

 HISTORY:  55-year-old female with dyspnea, status post laparotomy.  To rule
 out  pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast
 followed by CTA of the chest post-administration of intravenous contrast,
 reconstructions were performed in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.

 COMPARISON:  With chest radiograph of [**2119-10-5**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is an ET tube in
 satisfactory position. There are moderate- to- large bibasal effusions with
 passive atelectasis of the lower lobes, more marked on the left.  There is
 atelectasis present at the lung bases. There are secretions/mucus in the left
 lower lobe bronchus, likley aspiration or retained bronchial secretions. There
 are scattered subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes.

 There is no central pulmonary embolism.  Small subsegmental pulmonary emboli
 in the lower lobes cannot be excluded due to atelectasis and effusions.  The
 coronary arteries arise from the normal expected anatomical location.  There
 is calcific plaque present in the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 There is no aortic dissection.

 The esophagus is minimally dilated and thick walled throughout its course.
 There is minimal upper abdominal ascites, likely post-operative. The
 visualized liver and spleen appear unremarkable.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  There are no worrisome bone lesions.

 CONCLUSION:
 1.  No pulmonary embolism.

 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis and effusions, more marked in the left lower lobe.

 3.  Atherosclerotic/calcific plaque is present in the left anterior descending
 coronary artery.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT

 INDICATION: 85-year-old woman with pneumonia requiring antibiotics.

 The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1411**] and [**Doctor Last Name 155**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 155**], the
 Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a single-lumen PICC line measuring 37 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the endotracheal tube and
 the nasogastric tube have been removed.  The other monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is
 still slightly enlarged, however, the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis
 has slightly decreased in extent.  There is no secured evidence of pleural
 effusions.  The strong intrapulmonary vascular markings nevertheless suggest

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  18-year-old male with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and
 abdomen.

 TECHNIQUE:  Trauma torso with IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a gunshot wound to the left upper chest
 with tiny metallic fragments of bullet along the expected (anterior to
 posterior) trajectory through left lung apex. Along this tract (S2:10), there
 is air and blood. There is also complete collapse of the left upper lobe. A
 chest tube has been placed and terminates at the left lung apex, very close to
 the left subclavian artery. Retraction is recommended. There is a very small
 left anteromedial pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema is tracking along the
 left shoulder and chest musculature.  The right lung is unremarkable except
 for dependent atelectasis. No bony injury is apparent in the upper chest.

 The heart, pericardium, aorta, and great vessels appear unremarkable.  There
 is slight irregularity to the contour of the left subclavian artery, which
 could be related to the takeoff of a branch vessel.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The NG tube tip is coiled in the stomach. The
 liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, stomach, small
 and large bowel loops appear unremarkable.  There is no free intra- abdominal
 fluid, and no evidence of vascular injury.

 PELVIS:  Pelvic ureters, bladder, small and large bowel loops are
 unremarkable. Foley catheter noted in the bladder.  There is stranding around
 the right common femoral artery, which presumably is related to a line
 placement attempt.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is a bullet in the spinal canal at the level of the
 L2 inferior endplate. There is a second bullet embedded within the L3 vertebra
 with associated L3 vertebral fracture. L3 fracture involves the vertebral body
 and left pedicle.  Innumerable small bullet fragments are scattered within the
 musculature of the left back, within the spinal canal and around the fracture
 site.  A third bullet is located at the lateral aspect of the left femoral
 neck.  There are several adjacent metallic bullet fragments and possible small
 bony fragments. No complete femoral neck fracture is apparent (evaluation for
 fracture is limited due to streak artifacts). There is no sizeable associated
 soft tissue hematoma.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Gunshot wound to left upper chest with left upper lobe collapse and
 parenchymal hemorrhage.  Multiple small metallic fragments are located in
 close proximity to the left subclavian artery, although there is no direct
 evidence of arterial injury.  Small left anterior pneumothorax status post
 chest tube placement.

 2.  Two bullets in the lumbar spine, one located in the central spinal canal
 at L2, the other located in the vertebral body of L3 with associated L3
 fracture.

 3.  Bullet located at the lateral aspect of the left femoral neck without
 apparent femoral neck fracture, although visualization in this region is
 limited due to streak artifact.

 The study has been reviewed with the trauma team.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 INDICATION:  Followup.

 COMPARISON:  [**2148-3-26**].

 FINDINGS:  Clinically known COPD with chronic heart failure.

 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slight enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  In a generalized manner, moderate-to-severe reticular
 opacities are seen, mainly in the periphery of the lung, these are suggestive
 for fluid overload.  This suggestion is supported by the bilateral perihilar
 haziness and the slight increase in diameter of the apical pulmonary vessels.
 There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions, no focal parenchymal opacity
 suggestive of pneumonia are seen.

 major vessel injury, dissection with CTA.

 CTA NECK/UPPER CHEST:  Please also refer to the dictation of the trauma torso
 performed the same day for details.  The study was performed to specifically
 address the question of injury of the left subclavian artery or aortic arch
 due to the gunshot trauma.  Both vessels appear entirely intact and no
 dissection is visualized.  The visualized vessels of the neck are unremarkable
 as well. Again noted is consolidation of the left lung apex.  A chest tube
 terminates at the apex medially.  Multiple small metallic fragments are again
 located along the gunshot trajectory through the apex and left back.  Again
 noted is subcutaneous emphysema.  There are ground-glass opacities in the
 right upper lobe, which have slightly increased since the prior torso CT and
 could be related to aspiration.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of arterial injury.
 2. Increased opacities in the right upper lobe which could be related to
 aspiration.

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST

 INDICATION:  56-year-old with esophagectomy, left chest tube removal, looking
 for pneumothorax.

 This is compared with the prior from [**2101-1-13**].  There has been
 interval removal of the left chest tube.  There is now an air-fluid level at
 the left lung base.  There is a persistent right apical pneumothorax, which is
 small.  There is also some blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  There is
 some patchy opacity around the right-sided chest tube at the right lung base
 concerning for developing atelectasis or early consolidation.  There is a
 right subclavian line in standard position.

 IMPRESSION:  New air-fluid level in the left base after removal of chest tube.
 Developing patchy opacity around the chest tube in the right lung base, which
 may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia.  Other tubes and lines in
 standard position.  Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6402**] on the day of
 dictation.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Follow-up of a patient after esophagectomy.

 Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2101-1-10**] obtained at 5:00 p.m.

 The previously demonstrated left apical pneumothorax is not seen on the
 current radiograph.  The left chest tube now is more distally located compared
 to the previous study, although its sidehole still seemed within the pleural
 space.  The ET tube tip is 7.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube is at the
 level of hiatus, unchanged.  The right subclavian line tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction. There is no change in bibasilar atelectasis although the
 rest of the lungs are unremarkable. Small amount of bilateral subcutaneous
 emphysema is noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 No pneumothorax.
 Tubes and lines in place.
 Bibasal atelectasis.

 CTA OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2138-9-22**]

 INDICATION:  67-year-old with history of recent pneumonia, status post
 tracheostomy.  Please evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  Initial non-contrast CT of the chest was performed using 5-mm
 contiguous axial sections.  Following the uneventful administration of
 intravenous contrast, CTA was performed using 2.5-mm contiguous axial
 sections.

 Multiplanar reformations were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is no filling defect within the main, right, left, lobar, or
 segmental branches of the pulmonary artery to suggest the presence of
 pulmonary embolism.

 There is fluid within the right lower lobe bronchus, with distal
 atelectasis/consolidation.  Most of the right lower lobe is involved.
 Similarly, there is fluid within the right middle lobe bronchus.  Patchy
 atelectasis/consolidation is also present within the right middle lobe. Within
 the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, there are small patches of
 consolidation, consistent with pneumonia.  There is minimal patchy
 atelectasis/consolidation within the left lower lobe.  There is a calcified
 granuloma within the right upper lobe.

 There is diffuse interstitial thickening as well as foci of hazy ground glass
 attenuation, likely representing interstitial edema.   There are bilateral,
 right greater than left small to moderate effusions. Background pattern of
 emphysema is noted.

 As described on the previous CT of [**2137-7-8**], there is mediastinal and
 hilar lymphadenopathy.  Subcentimeter axillary nodes are identified.

 INDICATION:  Weight loss, abdominal distention, outside hospital CT showing
 ileitis and pelvic mass.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST

 There is no significant mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is no
 mediastinal mass. There is no significant focal pulmonary lesion.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS

 There is moderate volume ascites.  There is abnormal peritoneal enhancement,
 most marked in the pelvis.  There is extensive infiltration of the greater
 omentum with abnormal soft tissue, likely neoplastic.  There is extensive
 retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy involving the paraaortic regions and more
 extensively involving the small bowel mesentery.  Lymph nodes are noted in the
 small bowel mesentry measuring up to 3.9 cm in short axis diameter.

 In the pelvis, there is an ovoid soft tissue mass measuring 8 x 4.6 cm in
 diameter. This is involves a distal small bowel loop and appears to be
 outlined by enteric contrast.  It is difficult to be certain whether this
 represents a large mural deposit or a mucosal lesion.

 There is a focal area of decreased attenuation in segment VII of the liver
 measuring 2.1 cm in diameter compatible with a hepatic deposit.  There is no
 biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is normal.

 INDICATION: 69 year old man with dilated cardiomyopathy needs PICC access for
 home milrinone.

 The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3896**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18**]  performed the procedure. Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1037**] the attending radiologist supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right
 cephalic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a
 micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and
 immediately after establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then
 placed over a guidewire and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3627**] catherter measuring 42 cm was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under
 fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were
 then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
 dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
 immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided [**Last Name (un) 3627**]

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CTA of chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 INDICATION:  Patient with tachycardia, hypoxia, respiratory failure, and
 lymphoma.  Rule out acute pathology.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT acquisitions of the chest, abdomen, and
 pelvis were acquired after the administration of oral and intravenous
 contrast.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso from [**2166-7-27**].

 REPORT:

 The examination is suboptimal for evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma but
 within this limitation, no gross central embolism is seen.  The patient has an
 ET tube in situ, its tip in appropriate position.  An NG tube is also seen.
 There is mild concentric thickening of the entire esophagus, not previously
 appreciated on examination from three days previously and felt unlikely to be
 of much significance.  Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is limited by
 respiratory motion.  Within this limitation, there is no evidence of gross
 consolidation.  There is bibasal pleural thickening with small effusions and
 atelectasis, which has developed from [**2166-7-27**], but the degree of
 atelectasis is not thought likely to be responsible for the patient's acute
 decline.  The major airways are essentially patent to the subsegmental level,
 although again evaluation is a little limited.  A small subpleural tag is
 identified in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.  The aorta appears
 grossly normal and there is no evidence of aortic dissection.  No gross
 effusion is seen to suggest cardiac tamponade.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:

 Examination is limited by combination of suboptimal bolus timing and beam
 hardening from the patient's arms.  No gross liver pathology is identified.
 There is moderate ascites.  There is unchanged diffuse and widespread
 peritoneal carcinomatosis.  No frank liver pathology is identified.  There is
 moderate distention of the gallbladder but no overt signs suggestive of
 cholecystitis.  No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.  The pancreas
 appears grossly normal.  The spleen contains a focal defect along its
 superolateral aspect.  This may represent some heterogeneous perfusion because
 this is a relatively early phase of contrast.  Splenic infarction is not

 excluded.  Although there is possibly a mild increase in the amount of
 perisplenic fluid when compared to before, it is difficult to comment on the
 Hounsfield attenuation of this due to the extensive beam hardening artifact
 that is prevalent in this area.  The Hounsfield unit attenuation varies
 between 25 and 45 Hounsfield units, but for instance in the perihepatic and
 right paracolic area, it measures up to 40 Hounsfield units as well.  The
 adrenals appear unremarkable.  The kidneys show good uptake of contrast,
 although no gross excretion is seen.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:

 Again peritoneal carcinomatosis with a focal area of aneurysmal bowel
 dilatation is seen.  A few foci of air are identified here in locations where
 previously there was intraluminal contrast and these are assumed to be
 intraluminal although perforation cannot be definitively excluded.  There is
 certainly no evidence of gross intraperitoneal air, however.

 Extensive fluid is identified within the pelvis, much of which has a thick
 enhancing rim.  This, however, has not significantly changed from before.

 CT BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:

 No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.  There are some
 degenerative disease in the SI joints, enthesopathic change at the sartorius
 origins and there is some minimal spine degenerative disease.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  The examination is markedly suboptimal in its timing to evaluate the
 pulmonary arteries, but no central pulmonary embolism is identified and the
 lung parenchyma is grossly clear.

 2.  No acute intrahepatic abnormality is seen.  There is background extensive
 lymphadenopathy, aneurysmal bowel dilatation and peritoneal carcinomatosis
 grossly unchanged.  While a small peripheral perfusion defect in the spleen is
 seen, this most likely reflects either a perfusion abnormality in this early
 arterial phase study or even an infarct.  While splenic rupture is considered,
 it is less likely.  There is no splenomegaly and although the Hounsfield unit
 attenuation of the perisplenic fluid is markedly limited by streak artifact,
 there is no gross difference between this and perihepatic fluid.

 INDICATION:  73-year-old female intubated status post arrest.  Please evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process and evaluate ETT placement.

 FINDINGS:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest is reviewed without
 comparison.  Endotracheal tube is in place, in appropriate position roughly 4
 cm above the carina.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable, except to
 note minor calcification of the aortic knob.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 increased.  There are bilateral ill-defined perihilar opacities, right greater
 than left.  There is an 8-mm nodule in the right costophrenic sulcus.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Ill-defined bilateral perihilar consolidations, differential includes ARDS
 and multifocal pneumonia.  Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is possible,
 although the cardiac silhouette is not particularly enlarged, and clinical
 history is not entirely consistent with pulmonary edema.

 2.  8-mm right lower lobe nodule is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 7152**], most probably
 representing a granuloma.  When the patient is clinically able, CT could be
 performed to confirm this suspicion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  85-year-old status post MVA, rule out injury.

 No prior studies for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
 symphysis pubis with the administration of IV contrast.  Delayed images
 through the liver were also obtained.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
 were viewed in conjunction with the axial.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 coronary arteries and aortic arch are seen.  Otherwise, the heart,
 pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable, without evidence of an acute
 injury.  There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy.

 The lungs are clear without evidence of a focal contusion.  There is a small
 amount of fluid within the right posterior pleural space in the region of
 multiple rib fractures, consistent with a small hemothorax.  Within this
 hemothorax, there is a sliver of bone from an adjacent rib fracture.  The
 airways are patent to the subsegmental level.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Within the right lobe of the liver, there
 is a large heterogeneous 5 cm predominantly hypodense lesion, and a smaller
 one measuring approximately 1.6 cm slightly cephalad.  On delayed images,
 these subsequently demonstrate centripetal enhancement, suggestive of
 hemangiomas. Linear hypodense structures coursing adjacent to the largest
 lesion, may reflect a minimally dilated intrahepatic duct.  There is no
 evidence of an acute injury in the liver.  The kidneys, gallbladder, spleen,
 adrenal glands, and pancreas are unremarkable. Stomach and bowel are within
 normal limits. There is no free air, free fluid, or adenopathy.  There are
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta, with atheromatous
 plaque seen. There is no evidence of an acute aortic injury.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Foley catheter courses into the bladder.

 (Cont)
 Prostate and rectum are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid or adenopathy.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are multiple minimally displaced right-sided rib
 fractures.  Specifically, there is a fracture involving the posterior right
 fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs; the lateral right ninth, tenth, and
 eleventh ribs; and the posterior right twelfth rib.

 There are minimally displaced fractures of the right transverse process at L3
 and L4.

 There is a displaced fracture of the left coracoid process, and a bone
 fragment in the joint space, possibly from the glenoid.  There is associated
 extensive soft tissue swelling and hematoma in the left upper extremity and
 around the deltoid.  Within the soft tissues in the right posterior pelvis,
 subcutaneous stranding may also possibly represent an area of contusion.

 Mild anterior wedging of the T5 and T7 vertebral bodies. Although there is no
 associated hematoma or retropulsion of fragments into the central canal, these
 may represent acute compression fractures. There is also slight irregularity
 of the inferior endplate of the T6 vertebral body, which likely represents a
 degenerative/Schmorl's node.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures, with an associated small right
 hemothorax.

 2.  Left coracoid fracture, with possible involvement of the glenoid, and
 associated extensive soft tissue swelling and hematoma.

 3.  Minimally displaced right transverse process fractures at L3 and L4.

 4.  Slight anterior wedging of T5 and T7 vertebral bodies, without associated
 hematoma or retropulsion.  These may represent an acute compression fracture.
 If clinically warranted, an MR may be obtained for confirmation.

 5.  Two rounded hypodense lesions within the liver, likely representing
 hemangiomas.

 Findings posted to the ED dashboard at the time of interpretation.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 INDICATION:  Low O2 saturation.

 COMPARISON:  [**2165-6-18**].

 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared very
 extensive diffuse and patchy pattern of opacity in all parts of the lung.  The
 pattern of opacity is predominantly alveolar and shows subtle individual air
 bronchograms, in parts of the lung, the very periphery is spared by the
 opacities.  Simultaneously, there is no pleural effusion and only minimal
 interstitial thickening suggestive of interstitial fluid accumulation.  In
 combination with the sudden onset, the patchy and alveolar elements of the
 pattern would be consistent with capillary permeability, lung edema,
 moderately increased size of the cardiac silhouette.

 abdominal pain and fever; evaluate for infiltrate.

 FINDINGS:  Two views are compared with remote examination dated [**2185-9-28**].  The
 lung volumes are now significantly lower, with new patchy opacity at the left
 lung base, likely representing subsegmental atelectasis, associated with small
 left pleural effusion.  The remainder of the lungs is clear, and there is no
 definite central adenopathy.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary
 vessels are within normal limits.  The tip and side-hole of an NG tube lie
 within a fluid-filled gastric fundus.

 IMPRESSION:  New patchy opacity at the left lung base, associated with small
 pleural effusion, likely representing atelectasis; this likely reflects the
 severe pancreatitis with ""pancreatic ascites.""

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of ET tube placement.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to serial chest radiographs from
 [**6-18**] and [**2165-6-19**] and CT torso from [**2165-6-18**].

 ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The left internal jugular line tip is
 in mid SVC.  The NG tube tip is in proximal stomach.

 Cardiomegaly is mild, unchanged.  Widespread parenchymal consolidations have
 slightly progressed since [**2165-6-19**] obtained at 8 p.m., but markedly
 progressed (virtually new) since [**2165-6-18**].  This rapid development of the
 findings is consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema (cardiogenic
 or noncardiogenic) or ARDS in the presence of appropriate course.  Virtually
 no pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Thus the cardiogenic or pulmonary edema
 is less likely.

 Findings were discussed in detail with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6005**] over the phone at the time
 of dictation.

 COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY OF THE THORAX

 INDICATION:  History of COPD and restrictive pulmonary function tests with
 reduced DLCO, assessment for development of interstitial lung disease.

 COMPARISON:  [**2129-9-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric CT acquisitions over the entire thorax in inspiration,
 additional images in expiration.  No administration of intravenous contrast
 material.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, there is unchanged mild
 centrilobular emphysema in the apical lung regions, mild dilatation of the
 thoracic aorta, and mild malacia changes of the trachea at the thoracic inlet.

 Newly appeared is a diffuse and rather inhomogeneous but mainly subpleural and
 slightly apical predominant pattern of both ground-glass opacities and a
 subtle nodularity.  Simultaneously, the lung volumes could have slightly
 decreased.  In conjunction with the history of the patient, the pattern could
 suggest advanced RB-ILD in transition to DIP.  Another consideration would be
 early NSIP, although the apical predominance would not be typical for this
 situation.

 At the bases of the lingula and the middle lobe, subtle parenchymal scars have
 newly appeared.  Otherwise, there are no major parenchymal changes.  Unchanged
 mild bronchial wall irregularities.  No evidence of pleural effusions.  In
 expiration, unchanged mild airtrapping is seen.

 IMPRESSION:  Newly occurred diffuse, inhomogeneous, and slightly apical
 predominant pattern of parenchymal opacities that suggests either RB-ILD or
 DIP.  Early NSIP is less likely given the distribution of the changes.

 Otherwise, there are no relevant changes as compared to the previous
 examination of [**2129-9-12**].

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Abnormal lymph node conglomerate in the axillary and mediastinal nodal
 stations.  Given history of presumed connective tissue disease status post
 treatment, lymphoproliferative disorder may be considered.

 2.  Bilateral lower lobe ground-glass opacity may be related to breathing
 artifact versus atelectasis.

 3.  Small pericardial effusion.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  Status post central venous line placement, assess for
 pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position demonstrates a left subclavian approach central venous line seen to
 terminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  Noted is an overlying chest tube terminating in the lower neck
 region.  Most likely, this tube is external to the patient.

 When comparison is made with the next previous chest examination of [**2193-5-11**], there existed already a left-sided subclavian chest line in similar
 position.  It was confirmed, however, that a new line had been placed.
 Comparison also demonstrates that the left-sided pleural effusion has
 increased moderately.  No new parenchymal abnormalities are seen.

 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): CXWc MON [**2193-5-13**] 4:26 PM
  Extensive peripancreatic and omental fat stranding and multiloculated
  peripancreatic fluid collections have worsened since the prior exam.
  Multiseptated fluid collections are present extensively throughout the upper
  abdomen, but are not amenable to percutaneous drainage.  No evidence of
  pancreatic necrosis.  Increase in left pleural effusion and associated
  atelectasis, without lobar consolidation that would suggest pneumonia.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  52-year-old man, febrile and with elevated white count; history
 of pancreatitis.

 COMPARISON:  [**2193-4-28**] and [**2193-5-3**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest,
 abdomen and pelvis following administration of oral and intravenous contrast
 material.  Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained.

 CT CHEST:  There has been an interval increase in left pleural effusion with
 associated compressive atelectasis, now moderate in size.  There is
 minimal right- sided dependent atelectasis, without pleural effusion.  The
 heart is normal in size, without pericardial effusion.

 Within the lungs, there is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The
 tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels.  The great vessels are
 unremarkable.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Since the prior study 10 days ago, there has been further
 increase in the already striking degree of omental and mesenteric fat
 stranding. Additionally, the large multiloculated peripancreatic fluid
 collection has also greatly increased in extent, now extending from the
 pancreatic tail and the top of the gastrosplenic ligament, through the left
 anterior perirenal space and the pericolic gutter along the descending colon.
 Given the multiple internal septations, percutaneous drainage is not feasible.
 The pancreas itself again appears to enhance uniformly, without gross areas of
 necrosis.

 Multiple loops of small bowel remain dilated.  This is worse proximally, with
 a poorly defined possible transition point in the right lower quadrant
 (2:111), where the more distal loops appear decompressed.  This could be a
 pancreatitis-related ileus, but the possible transition point raises the
                                                             (Over)

 question of partial small-bowel obstruction.

 The liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys and adrenal glands are unremarkable.

 CT PELVIS:  As described, loops of small bowel are dilated, maximally
 measuring 4.4 cm.  A possible transition point is located in the right lower
 quadrant, with decompressed bowel distally.  Gas, stool and oral contrast
 material is present within the rectum and sigmoid colon.  There is a small
 amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  Mesenteric fat stranding extends into the
 pelvis from the peripancreatic focus.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are no bony lesions, fractures or soft tissue
 abnormalities.


 IMPRESSIONS:
 1.  Interval increase in peripancreatic inflammatory changes, multiloculated
 fluid collection extending into the left pericolic gutter and along the
 descending colon. Percutaneous drainage is not feasible given the multiple
 internal septations.  No evidence of pancreatic necrosis.

 2.  Apparent partial small-bowel obstruction, with transition point in the
 right lower quadrant.

 3.  Interval increase in left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.

 emphysema, to evaluate for pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**8-28**], there has been the development of
 diffuse subcutaneous air within pectoral muscle bundles as well as extending
 up to the neck.  No definite evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with prominence of interstitial
 markings that could well represent some elevated pulmonary venous pressure in
 this patient who has undergone a previous CABG procedure.  In addition, the
 interstitial changes could reflect chronic pulmonary disease, as suggested on
 the previous examination.

 HISTORY:  77-year-old man with pneumonia status post extubation, now with
 respiratory distress, evaluate for infiltrate and edema.

 FINDINGS:  In the interim, a new endotracheal tube has been placed.  The tip
 terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina bifurcation.  The placement of
 endotracheal tube has resulted in significant reexpansion of both lung volumes
 with persistent yet lesser bibasilar atelectasis; left still more than right.
 Areas of right perihilar consolidation is again noted, likely representing
 pneumonia and less likely edema.  There is minimal right pleural effusion
 slightly more than the left pleural effusion.  The lines, leads and tubes are
 in appropriate position, unchanged from the previous examination.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post reintubation with reexpansion lung volumes and less lower lobe
 atelectasis, which are more pronounced on the left side
 2.  Persistent right perihilar consolidation, which is more likely in favor of
 pneumonia and/or aspiration and less likely asymetric edema.
 3.  Small bilateral, right more than left, pleural effusions.

 INDICATION:  IV access needed for access.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30603**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29638**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29638**],
 the Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a double-lumen PICC line measuring 42 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 7-French
 double-lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach. Final
 internal length is 42 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.  The line is ready
 to use.

 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position,
 and analysis is performed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study
 obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  During the interval, the ETT
 has been removed, and a tracheostomy cannula has been placed which is in good
 tracheal position with its most distal end position some 5 cm above the level
 of the carina.  Previously described right internal jugular sheath and
 left-sided internal jugular approach central venous line are in unchanged
 position.  No pneumothorax has developed.  The previously described
 right-sided pleural effusion is less marked, but this might be related to mild
 changes in patient position that have occurred.  The previously described
 parenchymal density in retrocardiac position, obliterating diaphragmatic and
 distal thoracic aortic contours, remains.  No new abnormalities are
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature does not show any congestive pattern

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with fever after recent repair
 of ventral hernia.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 early at 09:56 a.m.

 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The right internal jugular line tip is in
 low SVC.  There is additional increase in the opacities of the left lung that
 might represent  developing infection.  The right basal atelectasis is
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of failure.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion, although small amount of pleural fluid cannot be excluded.

 HISTORY:  Complicated ventral hernia repair with fistula now status post I and
 D of the abdominal wall abscess and debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue
 and muscles with affixation of VAC device.

 Comparison is made to [**2101-9-16**] exam

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest,
 abdomen, and pelvis with oral contrast only.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformations were evaluated.

 Please note the exam was significantly limited due to patient inability to
 raise arms overhead resulting in the large amount of beam-hardening artifact
 throughout the chest and abdomen.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  Bilateral central venous catheters
 are noted to terminate within the SVC and the patient is noted to be
 intubated.  No axillary or central lymph nodes meeting CT criteria for
 pathological enlargement.  There is no pericardial effusion with a small-to-
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compression atelectasis.
 Remaining lung parenchyma displays no discrete consolidation.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  Small hypoattenuating hepatic
 lesion is again noted, likely benign cyst with unenhanced images of the liver,
 spleen, nasogastric tube containing stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and right

 adrenal gland appearing unremarkable.  The left adrenal gland is noted to be
 thickened but stable in appearance.  Left-sided hydronephrosis is not
 significantly changed.  Scattered non-pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal
 or mesenteric lymph nodes are unchanged.  No pneumoperitoneum is noted.

 Large ventral wall surgical defect with oral contrast noted within the
 adjacent VAC dressing consistent with known fistula is again identified.  The
 amount of intra-abdominal ascites appears slightly increased.  Left flank
 wound is now noted to be open and debrided.  Mild subcutaneous emphysema is
 noted adjacent to this area. Diffuse anasarca is again noted.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  Fluid is noted surrounding probable
 residual radiopaque fecal material within the rectal vault.  Air is noted
 within a Foley-containing urinary bladder.  The Foley does appear to be
 slightly angulated upward and abuts the base of the superior bladder wall.  No
 pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymph nodes are noted. The
 amount of intrapelvic ascites appears slightly increased.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are present.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Markedly limited CT without intravenous contrast and due to beam-hardening
 artifact.  Beyond new post-surgical changes along the left lateral abdominal
 wall and slightly increased intra-abdominal and intrapelvic ascites, the exam
 is not appreciably changed.

 2.  Large ventral wall abdominal defect with persistent fistulous connection
 as displayed by oral contrast within the collection bag.

 3.  Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with probable compression
 atelectasis.  Underlying infection within these regions of consolidation
 cannot be excluded by CT.

 4.  Stable left-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter.

 open abdomen.  Patient with persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and altered
 mental status.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs from [**2101-9-14**] through [**2101-9-20**],
 4:51 a.m.

 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above the
 carina.  The OG tube is seen, likely within the stomach.  A left IJ central
 venous catheter is again seen at the venous confluence.

 Heart size remains enlarged.  However, there is less prominence of the
 vascular pedicle.  Compared to 10 hours prior, there is improvement in
 pulmonary edema with improved aeration of the upper lungs, particularly on the
 left.  Lung volumes remain low, and there is still prominence of the right
 paratracheal region.  Left retrocardiac opacity again likely represents
 pleural effusion with atelectasis.  There is also likely small right pleural
 effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.

 IMPRESSIONS:  Improvement in pulmonary edema since [**02**] hours prior.  Prominence
 of the right paratracheal soft tissues and left retrocardiac opacity persist.

 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG and atrial fibrillation with altered mental
 status from Nursing Home.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed the day earlier.

 This examination is very limited due to the technique including obscuration of
 the upper lungs by the patient's head and external device.

 Allowing for these limitations, there appears to be increase in left lower
 lobe opacity and probably new opacity in the right upper lobe.  There are no
 enlarging pleural effusions.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Pacemaker leads
 remain in place.

 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in the left upper lobe and probably new opacity
 in the right upper lobe suggests worsened pneumonia.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with acute renal failure, requisition
 for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.

 DIAGNOSIS:  Renal failure.

 INDICATION:  Renal failure.

 PROCEDURE:  Temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.

 PHYSICIANS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2143**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 577**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 577**] was the attending
 physician who was present and supervising through the entire procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local.  Anesthesia was used using a total of 10 cc of 1%
 lidocaine.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  After risks, benefits and alternatives of the
 proposed procedure as well as those of conscious sedation were thoroughly
 explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The patient was taken
 to the angiographic suite and placed in supine position.  The right neck was
 prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed.  Ultrasound guidance was used to place a micropuncture needle into
 the right internal jugular vein inferiorly.  Hard copy ultrasound images were
 obtained before and after venous access documenting vessel patency. A 0.018
 wire was then passed through the needle and into the SVC under flouroscopic
 guidance . A skin [**Doctor Last Name 724**] was made over the needle and needle was then removed. A
 micropuncture sheath was then placed over the wire. The inner introducer and
 wire were then removed.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16**] wire was then passed through the sheath and
 into the IVC. Next, the sheath was removed and serial dilation of the skin and
 subcutaneous tissues was performed.  Next, an angio dynamics 15.5 French
 temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed over the wire under fluoroscopic
 imaging. The wire and inner introducer were then removed. The tip was
 positioned within the right atrium.  The catheter ports were aspirated and
 flushed.  A silk suture was used x2 to secure the catheter in place.  A
 sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well without
 immediate complication.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated temporary hemodialysis catheter via the right
 internal jugular vein.  The catheter is ready to use.

 HISTORY:  Nasogastric tube placement.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a nasogastric tube that can be followed only to the mid portion
 of the esophagus.

 This information was not telephoned to the referring clinician because a later
 study showed the nasogastric tube properly placed.

 x10 mm hypodensity in the liver, unchanged from prior exam. Spleen, and
 pancreas are within normal limits.  The gallbladder is absent or contracted.
 The adrenal glands are thickened bilaterally.  There is a small amount of
 ascites, decreased overall compared to prior exam.  There is no
 hydronephrosis. Evaluation of the bowel demonstrates no evidence of bowel
 obstruction.  The colon is distended with contrast throughout.  There is a
 small hiatus hernia. There is a left abdominal pigtail drain.

 CT SCAN OF THE PELVIS:  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.  There is
 free fluid in the pelvis.  There is a percutaneous drain in the left abdomen.
 No new intraperitoneal collection.  There is a midline abdominal open wound
 unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-sized right pleural effusion with associated
 atelectasis.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.

 SUPINE AP RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the carina
 in good position.  A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach with side
 port well below the diaphragm.  In this supine AP technique, the cardiac
 silhouette appears enlarged.  Mild calcifications at the aortic arch are
 evident.  There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left
 lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.  Mild blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle may reflect underlying pleural effusion.  Mild
 cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature is additionally noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in good position. Mild
 congestive heart failure and possible left lower lobe infiltrate.

 INDICATION:  39-year-old man with tachycardia and positive D-dimer.

 COMPARISON:  Not available at [**Hospital1 99**], note is made of chest radiograph dated
 [**2197-9-1**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained following
 administration of 100 cc of Optiray intravenously.  Multiplanar reformatted
 images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  The evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is severely limited by
 bolus timing.  No thrombus is noted in the main pulmonary arteries, more
 distal branches cannot be evaluated.  Bibasal patchy opacities are noted in
 dependent positions, highly concerning for aspiration.  No pathologically
 enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes are noted.  Prominent
 prevascular lymph nodes are present, measuring up to 9 mm in short axis
 diameter.  The airways are patent to the segmental levels bilaterally.

 This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, imaged
 gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Small hiatal hernia is
 present.  There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Study limited for evaluation of PE, no thrombus in the main pulmonary
 arteries.

 2.  Bibasal consolidations, in the patient with altered mental status, highly
 concerning for aspiration.

  Progression of right upper lobe pathcy opacities compared to [**2163**]- perhaps a
  chronic indolent infection (i.e. granulomatous in setting of calcified hilar
  and mediastinal lymph nodes). However, some have increased in size and a slow
  growing neoplasm (ie BAC) cannot be excluded. Small effusions, anasarca, and
  small ascities. Massive right hydroureter again seen with ight renal cortical
  thinning. Prominent retroperitoneal/pelvic lymph nodes, moreso than in [**2163**],
  of unclear etiology. Perisplenic 2.4 cm soft tissue density may represent
  splenule, though unclear an unchanged.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease, endocarditis,
 and fevers.  Evaluate for abdominal abscess.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2164-2-21**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
 were obtained with multiplanar reformatted images.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Compared to [**2164-1-24**], many of the previously
 noted prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are now calcified with calcified hilar
 lymph nodes also observed bilaterally.  Atherosclerotic calcifications involve
 the thoracic aorta and its branches including the coronary arteries.  There is
 no pericardial effusion.  A 1.3 cm round right thyroid hypodensity may
 represent a cyst but is incompletely evaluated.  There are small right greater
 than left pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.

 There has been progression of multiple patchy opacities in the right upper
 lobe compared to [**2163**] with many of the previously identified opacities
 persisting. Many of these also demonstrate slight progression in size. For
 example, a 12 x 13 mm opacity (2:27), previously measured 8 x 4 mm.  More
 peripheral nodular parenchymal densities in the posterior segment of the right
 upper lobe (i.e. 6 mm, 2:19) are more conspicuous compared to [**2163**].  A 6mm
 left upper lobe nodular opacity (2:21) is also slightly increased in size
 compared to [**2163**].  The airways are patent to the subsegmental level
 bilaterally.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The patient is status post cholecystectomy with
 streak artifact limiting evaluation of the gallbladder fossa.  Mild periportal

 edema is noted. Extensive pancreatic calcifications and atrophy is consistent
 with chronic pancreatitis without peripancreatic fluid collection. A 9- mm
 hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the spleen (2:59) is too small to
 characterize and probably seen on prior. A 2.4 x 1.7 cm rounded perisplenic
 density (2:57) near the tail of the pancreas attenuates similar to spleen, and
 may represent a splenule appearing unchanged compared to [**2164-1-24**].  The
 adrenal gland appear normal. The left kidney is unremarkable without
 hydronephrosis. Massive chronic right hydronephrosis is associated with
 progression of renal cortical thinning since [**2163**].

 There is a small amount of free peritoneal fluid.  There are extensive
 atherosclerotic calcifications involving the abdominal aorta and its branches,
 though the abdominal aorta is of normal caliber.  There is no
 pneumoperitoneum. Multiple prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes measure up to
 10 mm in short axis, more conspicuous compared to prior.  Intra- abdominal
 loops of large and small bowel are of normal caliber. The appendix is
 identified in the right lower quadrant and appears not significantly changed
 compared to [**2164-1-24**].

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, and bladder are
 unremarkable.  Irregular contour of the uterus is consistent with fibroids,
 many of which appear calcified. Left pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy is
 noted with a left pelvic sidewall lymph node measuring 1.2 x 2.7 cm,
 previously 0.9 x 2.6 cm.

 Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 There is extensive anasarca.  Apparent skin thickening involving the right
 breast does not appear significantly changed compared to [**2164-1-24**] but is
 incompletely evaluated.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Slowly progressive patchy and nodular consolidations predominating in the
 right upper lobe most likely represent an indolent granulomatous process,
 possibly sarcoidosis though granulomatous infection/bronchiolitis are other
 diagnostic considerations.

 2.  Prominent retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes, more prominent compared
 to [**2164-1-24**] but of unclear etiology.

 3.  Massive right hydronephrosis and cortical thinning likely secondary to
 chronic right UPJ obstruction.

 4. Findings raising the question of chronic pancreatitis.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2188-4-12**].  Chest CT of [**2188-4-10**] and [**2188-4-21**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis following the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material.
 Oral contrast material was instilled through the post-pyloric tube.
 Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  At the lung bases, extensive interstitial and
 ground-glass opacities involving both lung bases, but largely sparing the
 anterior portion of the right middle lobe, have improved since the most recent
 chest CT.  Additionally, there has been resolution of bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The heart is enlarged, but there is no pericardial effusion.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted of the coronary vessels and the
 aortic valve.

 In the abdomen, a PEG tube terminates in the stomach, and a post-pyloric
 feeding tube terminates in the proximal jejunum.  The liver, gallbladder,
 pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance
 and excrete contrast symmetrically, with large simple cysts bilaterally,
 unchanged.  There is no hydronephrosis or renal mass.  The distal stomach and
 duodenum are decompressed.  The abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic
 calcification, as do its major branches. Additionally, the infrarenal
 abdominal aorta shows stable minimal aneurysmal dilatation to 2.4 cm.
 Vascularity is otherwise unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid in
 the abdomen. Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes not enlarged
 by size criteria.

 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the NG
 tube.  Mediastinal drains and left chest tube are in unchanged positions.  The
 lung volumes are lower, most likely due to termination of mechanical
 ventilation.  There is increase in volume overload and also appearance of new
 right upper lobe and bibasilar opacities that might represent atelectasis,
 although aspiration cannot be excluded given the rapid development.
 Pneumothorax is seen in the left apex, small.  Attention on the subsequent

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of PICC line placement.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2188-3-28**].

 Right internal jugular line has been inserted with its tip currently
 projecting at the level of the junction of internal jugular vein on the right
 brachiocephalic vein.  The right PICC line tip is in low SVC.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Extensive opacities involving the
 lungs bilaterally did not change significantly since [**2188-3-27**].  They
 might represent continues pulmonary edema but given their relatively focal
 distribution, they are worrisome for infectious process.  Correlation with
 clinical symptoms and post-diuresis evaluation is highly recommended.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**3-16**], the cardiac silhouette remains
 at the upper limits of normal in size.  However, there is engorgement of
 pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles and poor definition of the hemidiaphragms
 is consistent with pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectatic change.  In the
 left and possibly also right upper zones, there are areas of somewhat
 ill-defined opacification that could represent developing aspiration or
 infectious pneumonia.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT

 INDICATION: IV access needed for difficult venous access.

 The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 685**] [**Name (STitle) 633**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29638**] reviewed
 the study.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen Vaxcel PICC line measuring 44 cm in
 length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in
 the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by
 a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 5 French
 double-lumen Vaxcel PICC line placement via the right brachial venous
 approach. Final internal length is 44 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The
 line is ready to use.

 HISTORY:  Refractory hypertension and recent myocardial infarction.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies are available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 10cm and the left 9.9cm.  The right
 kidney is notable for multiple renal cysts the largest of which is located
 laterally near the interpolar region and measures 29x25mm. Normal blood supply
 is noted to the right kidney with the main renal artery showing normal
 arterial waveforms and an RI of 0.79.  The resistive indices in the upper, mid
 and lower poles on the right are 0.70, 0.76 and 0.65 respectively.  These all
 show normal arterial waveforms.  The right renal vein is patent with a normal
 venous waveform.

 The left kidney is notable for scattered renal cysts, the largest of which
 measures 8 x 8 mm.  The vascular supply to the left kidney is unremarkable
 with the left renal artery RI measuring 0.76.  The resistive indices in the
 upper, mid and lower poles are 0.72, 0.76 and 0.71 respectively.  The main
 renal vein on the left is patent with a normal venous waveform.  Note is made
 of a 24 x 18 x 25 mm relatively isoechoic lesion at the lower pole of the left
 kidney which is only partially visualized on this current study.  The bladder
 is decompressed and contains a Foley catheter.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Grossly normal arterial waveforms to the kidneys bilaterally with no
 evidence of renal artery stenosis.
 2)  Poorly characterized lesion at the lower pole of the left kidney.
 Recommend repeat son[**Name (NI) 536**] assessment for more definitive characterization.

 HISTORY:  Status post MI with decreased oxygen saturation, question pulmonary
 edema.

 FINDINGS:  There are no old films available for comparison.  The heart is
 upper limits of normal in size.  The aorta is tortuous.  There are increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally with bilateral pleural effusions vs. pleural
 thickening.  It is unclear how much of this appearance is due to chronic lung
 disease.  There may be some superimposed CHF and an underlying infectious
 infiltrate cannot be totally excluded.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-11**] and 24:

 Mediastinum is shifted to the left to a stable degree post-operatively as the
 left pneumonectomy space fills with fluid.  Of note the left hemidiaphragm is
 markedly elevated.  Poor aeration at the base of the right lung could be
 atelectasis, but bears watching to exclude pneumonia.

 Nasogastric tube passes into a distended stomach and out of view.
 Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall and neck is stable.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea and tachycardia with confusion.  Evaluate for underlying
 pulmonary embolism.

 No priors are available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest without
 and with intravenous contrast per CTPA protocol.  Coronal, sagittal, and
 oblique reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:   Unenhanced images of
 the chest display probable stent within the LAD and mild atherosclerotic
 disease within the coronary circulation but no intramural hematomas.  Contrast
 and contrast-enhanced images display no evidence of aortic dissection or
 pulmonary embolism, however subsegmental branches at the bases are not well
 opacified. No pathologically enlarged axillary lymph nodes identified.
 Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, the largest within the lower left
 paratracheal chain measuring up to 10 mm in short axis. There is a prominence
 of fat within the upper mediastinum and pericardium. Evaluation of lung
 parenchyma is somewhat limited due to respiratory artifact but displays only
 regions of subsegmental and segmental lower lobe atelectasis.  No pleural or
 pericardial effusion is identified.

 Please note this examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
 The included portions of the upper abdomen displays the patient to be status
 post cholecystectomy but are otherwise normal.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Mild scoliosis and degenerative changes are noted within the
 spine.  No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary embolism (with limitations as above),
 aortic dissection, or focal pneumonia.

 HISTORY:  Trauma, tracheostomy, left lower lobe pneumonia.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-8**] through [**6-14**]:

 Left pleural effusion has been increasing progressively, now large enough to
 collapse the entire left lung and shift the mediastinum to the right.
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Right lung clear.  Right subclavian
 line ends in the SVC.  Whether the left pleural effusion is hemothorax or

 FINDINGS:  Comparison made to multiple priors, most recently [**2117-4-2**] and
 [**2116-9-21**].  Left IJ hemodialysis catheter remains in place, tip in the right
 atrium.  Lung volumes are low, slightly accentuating the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, which is otherwise unchanged.  Increased bibasilar opacities,
 particularly at the left costophrenic angle, probably reflect interval
 increase in volume status.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly
 increased, but there is no overt pulmonary edema.  Bilateral old healed rib
 fractures are unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Low lung volumes, with likely bibasilar atelectasis and increased volume
 status.

 EXAMINATION:  Trauma, chest, [**2161-6-4**].

 INDICATION:  MVC.

 FINDINGS:  No prior comparison.  Evaluation is limited by portable supine
 technique and overlying trauma board.  Endotracheal tube is in place, but tip
 nearly reaches the right main stem bronchus, and should be withdrawn for more
 optimal positioning.  Nasogastric tube is in place, extending below the
 diaphragm and out of view.  There is evidence of median sternotomy and prior
 cardiac surgery.  Despite this, and portable supine technique, the upper
 mediastinum appears widened.  There are multiple right rib fractures,
 approximately right ribs 5, 6, and 7, which are significantly displaced.
 Adjacent opacity may represent hemorrhage, contusion, or collapse. There is a
 small associated right pneumothorax.  Left rib fractures may be present as
 well, difficult to differentiate from overlying trauma board. Left lung is
 grossly clear.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple right rib fractures, and small associated right pneumothorax.
 2.  Widened mediastinum in this patient with significant chest trauma raises
 concern for vascular injury.  Further evaluation with CTA is recommended.
 3.  Endotracheal tube nearly reaches the right mainstem bronchus.  Recommend
 withdrawing tube 2-3 cm for more optimal positioning.

 Findings discussed via telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36550**] at 11:50 a.m. on [**2161-6-4**].

 STUDY:  CT torso.

 INDICATION:  Patient with history of trauma, for evaluation.  Patient is on
 Coumadin.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT acquisitions of chest, abdomen, and pelvis
 were acquired after the administration of intravenous contrast.

 COMPARISON:  Trauma series plain radiographs [**2161-6-4**].

 REPORT:

 CT CHEST:

 ETT tube in place. The patient has a right-sided chest tube, and the tip
 terminates just anterior to the atrium in the right side of the mediastinum,
 posterior to the sternum and should be reracted somewhat. There is evidence of
 a surgical emphysema along the entry site. A small residual pneumothorax only
 persists. Just inferior to the tract of the patient's chest tube, there is a
 focal area of cavitary consolidation which may represent a pulmonary
 laceration. The patient has an anterior mediastinal hematoma.  This has two
 components, a more superior component anterior to the brachiocephalic vessels
 and a more inferior component, centered just above the tip of the chest tube.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 The patient is status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient also
 has a valve in situ. Bilateral consolidation and effusions are identified.
 Within the heart, bypass grafting is identified. There is also evidence of an
 aortic valve replacement.  A nasogastric tube runs in its expected location in
 the esophagus terminating in the stomach.

 CT ABDOMEN:  There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
 Choledocholithiasis is identified.  Gallstones are also identified.  Some
 respiratory motion is identified in the upper abdomen, and allowing for this,
 no significant additional injury seen.  The spleen is normal.  Pancreas
 appears unremarkable.  There are no specific findings suggestive of duodenal
 injury.  Both adrenals are normal.  Both kidneys show good uptake of contrast.
 The left kidney is mildly anteriorly displaced by a retroperitoneal/posterior
 left pararenal space hematoma secondary to fracture of the L3 transverse
 process on the left side.

 CT PELVIS:  The patient is catheterized and the Foley catheter appears in good
 position.  There is extensive hematoma identified with thickening of the
 obturator muscles bilaterally, particularly on the right, and also the right
 piriformis muscle.  In addition, the hematoma is identified within the
 perivesical fat and in the prepubic Retzius space.  Multiple fractures are
 identified in the pelvis including complex fractures of the inferior pubic
 rami bilaterally, the superior pubic rami bilaterally and the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 178**]
 (Duverney type fracture) with a complex fracture estending  medially into the
 left SI joint.  In addition, more inferiorly, there is questionable widening
 of the left SI joint when compared to the other side.  Findings are concerning
 for pelvic instability.  In addition to the pelvic fractures, the hematoma was
 also mentioned, there are multiple sites of focal hyperenhancement worrisome
 for active extravasation.  These include at the level of the L3 transverse
 process fracture on the left side (2:71), in the left gluteal region (series
 2, image 86), anterior abdominal wall lower left (2:104), and medial to the
 patient's left acetabulum/pubic ramus junction (2:111) as well as the left
 transversalis muscle just lateral to the left inferior epigastric artery. The
 fracture here extends incidentally into the patient's left acetabulum
 anteriorly.  In addition to the multiple pelvic fractures, there are almost
 innumerable bilateral rib fractures involving most of the ribs on the right
 side as well as some of the left sided ribs.  While some of these are
 obviously displaced, no definitive flail segment is identified.  The vertebral
 column appears intact, and there is no evidence of vertebral body fracture
 outside the left L3 transverse process.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  Complex fractures as detailed above with complex and likely unstable
 pelvic fractures, and multiple potential sites of focal extravasation.
                                                             (Over)

 CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST

 REASON FOR EXAM:  80-year-old man status post MVC with multiple rib fractures
 and bilateral pleural effusion, now trach.  Evaluate for lobe collapse

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest MDCT was performed without contrast using 5mm and 1.25mm
 axial slice thickness.  Coronal and sagittal reformatations were also
 obtained.

 FINDINGS:  Since [**2161-6-4**], left pleural effusion significantly increased,
 now moderate to large, and is now heterogeneous, possibly due to blood.  The
 left lower lobe is completely collapsed and the left upper lobe is only
 aerated in its anterior segment.  Right pleural effusion remains small, with
 adjacent atelectasis.  A very tiny right pneumothorax is still present,
 decreased in size since the prior study.  Pneumoperitoneum is present.
 Subcutaneous gas collections persist.

 A tracheostomy is in expected position in this patient with prior sternotomy
 for AVR and CABG.  Nasogastric tube was removed.  Central venous line ends in
 the lower SVC.  Contusion is along the tract of the old right chest tube.
 Below the tract of the chest tube, cavitated opacity is now a soft tissue
 density, likely due to focal contusion.  Minimal adjacent ground-glass opacity
 could be due to minimal amount of prior peri-contusional hemorrhage.  Coronary
 artery calcifications are severe.  The mediastinal hematoma at the level of
 the aortic arch improved.  The lower part of the hematoma was likely a dilated
 vessel from the CABG, and not a hematoma.  Signs of anemia are suggested by
 relative hypodensity of intracardiac blood.

 This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note
 pneumoperitoneum.  There is no spinal fracture.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Enlarging left pleural effusion, now moderate to large, still layering
 along the posterior wall but more heterogeneous, could be due to blood.
 Complete collapse of the left lower lobe.  Partial collapse of the left upper
 lobe with residual aeration of the anterior segment.

 2.  Improving mediastinal hematoma.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2192-5-1**].

 The ET tube tip is approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz
 catheter tip is at the main pulmonary artery/right ventricle outflow tract.
 The left chest tube tip is in place.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The
 mediastinal drains are noted.  The cardiac contours did not change
 significantly compared to the pre-operative study.  There is a new periaortic
 opacity that might be consistent with an area of atelectasis or mediastinal
 hematoma and should be closely followed on the subsequent studies.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  Status post mitral valve replacement, worsening hypoxia, evaluate
 for possible pneumothorax.


 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next previous portable chest examination of [**2192-5-9**].  The
 patient is status post sternotomy.  The metallic structures of a St. Jude's
 valve prosthesis is identified in mitral valve location.  Previously existing
 Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed; however, the right internal jugular
 approach sheath remains in place.  No pneumothorax has developed.
 Postoperative enlargement of cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain
 stable.  No significant increase in mediastinal width observed.  As before,
 there is evidence of some linear atelectasis on the right lung base and
 obscuration of the diaphragmatic contour on the left side is suggestive of
 postoperative pleural densities and/or atelectasis.  All these findings,
 however, have not increased significantly since the study of [**5-9**].
 Comparison is also made with the frontal view of the preoperative chest
 examination of [**2192-5-1**].  It confirms the presence of the described
 postoperative changes.  The accessible pulmonary vascular pattern does not
 show any increase in comparison with the preoperative findings.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax, stable postoperative pulmonary
 changes.  Postoperative since [**5-9**].

 INDICATION:  Multiple rib fractures, status post bronchoscopy.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison made to multiple priors, most recently [**2161-6-12**], 6:19.

 Tracheostomy tube remains in place, roughly 6 cm above the carina.  Right
 subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in position, tip in the lower
 SVC.  Large left pleural effusion and associated left basilar atelectasis are
 not significantly changed.  Right lung aeration is slightly improved and could
 represent resolving areas of atelectasis versus contusion.  Multiple bilateral
 rib fractures are unchanged.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax.

 catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with
 mild cardiomegaly.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, probably
 increased on the right.  Lower right pleural tube as mentioned before can be
 within the fissure.  There is no pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous emphysema.  Left
 lobe retrocardiac opacity is unchanged from prior, worsened from [**6-5**],
 likely due to atelectasis.  Right lower lobe opacity has increased, could be
 due to increase in atelectasis.  Sternal wires are aligned.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  In EU, critcal blunt trauma to chest, evaluate ETT and chest
 tube.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with a preceding similar study obtained two and a half hours earlier.  The
 patient remains intubated, the position of the ETT has been adjusted and is
 now seen to terminate in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina.
 An NG tube reaches just below the diaphragm, but the side port is still above
 the hiatus.  As before, there is status post sternotomy and the metallic ring
 component of an aortic valve prosthesis is identified in place.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is slightly more plethoric which may be related to fluid
 administration.  There is, however, no evidence of pulmonary edema or
 significantly increased pleural effusions in the lateral pleural sinuses.
 Moderate amount of chest wall emphysema is now seen on the right side in the
 area of the multiple rib fractures.  Observed also on this chest examination
 are at least two rib fractures in the left lower thorax at level [**Doctor Last Name 7698**] 7 and
 8.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax on either side.  Right-sided chest
 tube advanced from the lateral wall is seen to terminate in the right hilar
 area presumably posteriorly in the pleural space.  No new local parenchymal
 infiltrates have developed.  Proper adjustment of ETT position, NG tube
 requires further advancement.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Right subclavian
 sheath in place.

 [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62869**]  PFI:  ETT position adjusted now correct, right-sided chest tube in
 place, no pneumothorax on either side.  Moderate amount of subcutaneous chest
 wall emphysema, in area of multiple right-sided rib fractures.  Observe plain
 chest examination demonstrates also left-sided rib.

 IMPRESSION:  Fractures in lower thorax.  No pneumothorax on either side.

 HISTORY:  ARDS, assess for interval change.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-18**] through 12:

 Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has become more severe, accompanied
 by increasing small to moderate bilateral pleural effusion suggesting the
 superimposition of volume dependent edema on the residual of ARDS.  There may
 also be a new small region of consolidation just superior to the right hilus
 which should be followed to exclude developing pneumonia.  The left suprahilar
 consolidation that has been present since [**4-14**], is less extensive today
 than it was a week ago, but unchanged over the past several days.  ET tube and
 right internal jugular line in standard placements, nasogastric tube passes
 below the diaphragm and out of view.  No pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-6**] and 31.

 Bilateral pulmonary consolidation predominantly upper lungs has worsened
 appreciably, now with a perihilar and lower lobe component consistent with
 either a very severe pneumonia or worsening pulmonary edema with an atypical
 distribution.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is another possibility, though the
 symmetry of the process argues against that.  Heart size is normal, given low
 lung volumes.  Pleural effusions are small, if any.  No pneumothorax.

 Lung volumes are better on this examination which may explain some of the
 apparent improvement in the symmetric severe pulmonary consolidation, with
 apical predominance.  Alternatively this may represent interval improvement,
 something which can be seen in such a short time with pulmonary edema or
 pulmonary hemorrhage, but not pneumonia.  Still, the findings are equivocal
 and infection is still a reasonable diagnosis.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural
 effusion if any is small on the left.  No pneumothorax.

 The pulmonary abnormality dates from [**3-27**], new compared to [**3-16**].  Could
 this be a pulmonary drug reaction.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST

 REASON FOR EXAM:  83-year-old man with past medical history significant for
 hypertension, diastolic CHF, status post right total knee replacement
 complicated by septic joint, status post washout and right gastrocnemius knee
 graft, transferred to MICU overnight for hypoxia.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest MDCT was performed without contrast using 5-mm and 1.25-mm
 axial sized thickness.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were also obtained.

 FINDINGS:  No prior study for comparison.  Correlation was made with multiple
 prior chest x-rays.

 Multifocal bilateral mostly perihilar and dependent areas of ground-glass
 opacity and septal thickening are associated with focal dense areas of
 peripheral consolidation in both upper lobes.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are layering.  Pericardial effusion is tiny.  Anemia is suggested by
 relative hypodensity of intracardiac blood.  Upper lobe predominant emphysema
 is present.  The right middle lobe is relatively spared from multifocal
 parenchymal opacities and some normal intervening lung is between areas of
 parenchymal abnormalities.

 Aortic valvular calcifications are mild.  Coronary artery calcifications are
 severe.  Mediastinal lymph nodes are scattered, up to 10 mm in the lower right
 paratracheal region.  Other lymph nodes are not enlarged using CT criteria.
 The main pulmonary artery is enlarged up to 3.5 cm, suggesting pulmonary
 hypertension. The trachea has a saber-sheath appearance at the thoracic inlet.
 Tiny punctate densities are in both bases, could be dystrophic calcification,
 calcified granuloma or aspirated barium.

 (Cont)

 This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note
 incompletely evaluated left kidney cyst and right kidney hypodensity, too
 small to characterize.  There is no bone lesion suspicious for malignancy.
 Degenerative changes are multilevel.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multifocal bilateral mostly perihilar and dependent ground-glass opacity
 and septal thickening with normal intervening lung and relatively spared right
 middle lobe, favoring widespread aspiration with possible developing ARDS.
 Interstitial edema is less likely due to sparing of the right middle lobe and
 areas of normal lung.  Hemorrhage is also less likely, given the clinical
 context.

 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Tiny pericardial effusion.

 3.  Upper lobe predominant emphysema.

 4.  Signs of anemia.

 5.  Severe coronary artery calcifications.  Mild aortic valvular
 calcifications.

 6.  Left kidney cyst and kidney hypodensity, too small to characterize, could
 be evaluated by ultrasound after the acute event if clinically relevant.

 7.  Signs of pulmonary hypertension.

 8.  Saber-sheath trachea.

 INDICATION:  IV antibiotics.  Failed bedside PICC placement.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  Preprocedure timeout was
 performed.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 833**],
 the attending radiologist, supervised the procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the
 guide wire, and a double lumen Vaxcel PICC line measuring 42 cm in length was
 then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC
 under fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.  The peel-away sheath and guide wire were
 then removed.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk sutures,
 flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  Patient tolerated the procedure
 well.  There were no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided double lumen
 PICC placement via the right brachial venous approach.  Final internal length
 is 42 cm, with tip positioned in the SVC.  The line is ready to use.

 STUDY:  CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast and reconstructions.

 INDICATION:  Septic shock with no clear source.

 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph [**2188-4-11**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the lung bases to
 the symphysis without contrast administration.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained and reviewed.  Only oral contrast administered.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST AND RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Widespread opacities within
 the lower lobes bilaterally persist with sparing of the right middle lobe and
 lingula.  Trace pericardial effusion.  Pacemaker leads in expected position.
 Mild-to-moderate calcifications of the aortic valve are of unknown hemodynamic
 significance.

 Evaluation of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic organs is significantly limited
 by lack of IV contrast administration.  However, no focal mass lesions are
 identified within the liver.  Gallbladder is mildly distended without
 surrounding fat stranding or wall thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.
 The pancreas appears within normal limits.  The spleen and abdominal loops of
 large and small bowel appear within normal limits.  Mild hypertrophy of the
 adrenal glands noted bilaterally.  Calcified atheromatous plaque of the
 abdominal aorta and iliac branches is mild to moderate.  There is no
 hydronephrosis.  Evaluation of the renal parenchyma is significantly limited
 by lack of IV contrast administration.  A 4.7-cm cystic lesion within the
 lower pole of the right kidney is not fully characterized (series 2:image 51).
 Presumed parapelvic cyst is noted within the upper pole of the right kidney
 measuring 2.3 cm.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Bladder demonstrates intraluminal Foley catheter,
 yet remains moderately distended with fluid and air and may need advancing.
 Sigmoid colon diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.  No
 free pelvic fluid demonstrated.  Prostate gland is enlarged measuring
 approximately 5.4 cm in transverse dimension.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Multilevel degenerative changes present.  Left total hip
 replacement.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion ins detected.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest with patient in sitting semi-upright
 position is analyzed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study
 obtained two and a half hours earlier.  The right internal jugular approach
 central venous line has been exchanged.  Its tip is now overlying the lower
 portion of the SVC but still some 2 cm above the expected entrance into the
 right atrium.  No pneumothorax has developed.

 The ETT has been advanced during the interval and is now seen to terminate in
 the entrance of the right main bronchus.  No atelectasis or occlusion of the
 airways present as yet.  It is recommended to withdraw the tube by
 approximately 4 cm.  Over the wire exchange of the right internal jugular
 approach central venous line has been performed and the tip is now overlying
 the lower SVC but still 2 cm above the expected entrance into the right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Previously described scattered
 infiltrates bilaterally in this patient with ARDS appear unchanged during the
 most recent interval.

 Telephone report was established with supervising nurse.

 CTPA INPATIENT

 REASON FOR EXAM:  83-year-old man with hypertension and hypoxia as well as
 blood on BAL, rule out PE.

 FINDINGS:  Since [**2188-4-10**], a right central venous line now ends in the
 SVC. A NGT ends in the stomach and the ETT ends in expected position.

 Moderate bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion increased.  Small
 pericardial effusion is unchanged.  Severe coronary artery and mild aortic
 valvular calcifications are stable.  Signs of anemia are suggested by relative
 hypodensity of intracardiac blood.

 Consolidation is denser in both bases than on the prior study, likely due to
 superimposed increased atelectasis.  Bilateral multifocal mostly perihilar and
 dependent consolidation and ground-glass opacity are associated with minimal
 septal thickening, sparing part of the right middle lobe and part of the left
 upper lobe, overall likely unchanged, maybe changed in some areas given
 different techniques.

 Upper lobe predominant emphysema is unchanged.  Scattered mediastinal lymph
 nodes are still not enlarged using CT criteria.  The main pulmonary artery is
 up to 3.6 cm, suggesting pulmonary hypertension.

 This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation but the upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.  There is no bone lesion suspicious for malignancy.

 HISTORY:  83-year-old man with respiratory failure status post trach, now with
 intermittent low-grade fevers.  Evaluate for new infiltrates.

 FINDINGS:  When compared to the prior studies, there has been no appreciable
 change.  Tracheostomy is appropriately placed and unchanged.  There is again
 noted areas of confluent opacities within the left lower and left upper lobes
 as well as within the right perihilar and peripheral areas in the right lung.
 These are all relatively stable and can be consistent with sequela of ARDS or
 more chronic fibrotic changes as described on multiple previous examinations.

 INDICATION:  19-year-old man, unrestrained driver with MVC, reported liver
 laceration on previous scan.

 COMPARISON:  Outside scan from [**Hospital3 14226**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained from the base of the neck
 through the proximal thigh after the administration of 130 mL of Optiray
 intravenously.  Sagittal and coronal reformations were derived.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

 The imaged thyroid enhances homogenously.  There is no mediastinal or hilar
 adenopathy.  There is areolar tissue suggestive of gynecomastia.  The
 pulmonary artery is normal in caliber at 2.4 cm.  The aorta is normal in
 course and caliber.  There is no mediastinal hemorrhage.  The heart is normal
 in size. There is no pericardial effusion.  Central airways are patent to the
 level of subsegmental bronchi.  There is no pulmonary mass, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a liver laceration (for
 example series 2, image 70) and perihepatic high attenuating material
 consistent with hemorrhage.  The spleen appears intact although there is a
 small amount of perisplenic fluid (series 2, image 76) with attenuation values
 compatible with hemorrhage.  The left kidney appears normal with a 11 mm
 hypodensity, too small to characterize, likely a benign cyst.  The right
 kidney has an irregular parenchymal margin and surrounding high attenuating
 fluid (series 2, image 18) suggestive of a small laceration and hemorrhage.
 The gallbladder, pancreas and abdominal loops of bowel appear normal.  There
                                                             (Over)

 The abdominal vasculature appears normal.  The abdominal aorta is normal in
 course and caliber.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

 The bladder, distal ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles and pelvic loops of
 bowel appear normal.  There is increased fluid in the pelvis from the prior
 scan with a hematocrit level (series 2, image 25) versus [**Hospital3 14226**] scan
 (series 4, image 84).

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  There is a transverse fracture through the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 178**]
 with minimal displacement and angulation.  No other fractures are seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  There is a liver laceration (AAST Grade 3) and associated hemoperitoneum.

 2.  Small right kidney laceration (likely AAST Grade 2) with associated
 hemorrhage.

 3.  Minimally displaced and angulated fracture of the right iliac.

 4.  Increased pelvic fluid with a hematocrit level in the pelvis.


 COMMENT:  These results were posted to the ED dashboard and discussed with the
 surgery team at 8 a.m.

 Assess for interval changes.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in supine
 position is analyzed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study of
 [**2188-4-21**].  The patient remains intubated.  ETT and NG tube in unaltered
 position.  Same holds for a right subclavian central venous line terminating
 overlying the mediastinum at a level 1 cm below the carina.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Previously described bilateral disseminated patchy infiltrates
 persist.  Suggestion made that super- imposition of volume dependent edema may
 contribute the diffuse bilateral pulmonary densities is likely.  Blunted
 pleural sinuses and poorly-identified diaphragmatic contours favor assumption
 of bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax in the apical area.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2188-5-4**].

 The tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip approximately 6 cm above the
 carina.  The feeding tube has been inserted in the meantime interval with its
 distal portion below the inferior margin of the film, thus cannot be
 evaluated.  There is interval improvement in the aeration of the entire left
 lung, especially left base and left apex with still present significant
 interstitial prominence.  Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be
 excluded.  Overall, when comparing to more remote radiographs dating back to
 mid [**Month (only) 2413**], there is overall gradual improvement of the lung appearance.

 The left PICC line tip can be followed to the junction of left brachiocephalic
 vein and SVC.

 INDICATION:  83-year-old male with new PICC line.  Evaluate tip.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison to [**2188-4-27**], the distal tip of the PICC line is
 coiled within the left brachiocephalic or azygos vein.  Distal tip of the
 right subclavian line projects over the mid SVC.  Diffuse parenchymal opacity
 appears more prominent in the periphery of the lungs bilaterally which may be
 related to technique; however, worsening areas of consolidation cannot be
 excluded. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from prior. A
 tracheostomy tube is again noted in the standard position.  A ring- like
 density is noted projecting over the left upper quadrant and likely represents
 a gastric tube.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left PICC line coiled in the left brachiocephalic or into the azygos.
 Recommend repositioning.

 2.  Increased prominence of peripheral opacification in the lungs
 bilaterally, may be due to technical factors; however, worsening areas of

 INDICATION:  59-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, admitted with MSSA
 sepsis.  Patient is now status post two-day line holiday.  Please place
 tunneled hemodialysis catheter

 OPERATORS:  Dr. [**Name (NI) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1414**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 307**], the attending radiologist,
 who was present throughout the entire procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  After explaining the risks, benefits and alternative management of
 the procedure, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought
 to the fluoroscopic suite and placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
 right side of the neck and upper chest were prepped and draped in a usual
 sterile fashion.

 The right internal jugular vein was visualized under ultrasound and it
 appeared clotted.  Micropuncture needle under fluoroscopic and ultrasound-
 guidance was then performed of the right IJ.  A 0.018 wire was attempted to be
 placed through this clotted right internal jugular vein; however, this was not
 successful.

 Next, the right external jugular vein was imaged and also accessed with
 micropuncture needle under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance. A 0.018 wire
 was placed through the needle into the right external jugular vein and a
 sheath exchanged for the needle. Contrast was administered through the sheath;
 however, the tip of sheath appeared to be in a collateral vein. Contrast
 demonstrated multiple small collateral veins over the upper right chest wall
 and contrast flowing through a large collateral vein to the left side.

 It was then decided that a left-sided IJ approach should be attempted.  The
 left side of the neck and left upper chest were then prepped and draped in the
 usual sterile fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a
 micropuncture needle under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance.  Contrast was
                                                             (Over)

 administered through the needle which showed narrowing of the long segment of
 the brachiocephalic vein.  Additional intravenous contrast was administered
 through the needle which demonstrated no filling of the SVC.  It was then
 decided that the right femoral vein should be attempted for access.

 Right groin and thigh were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 The right femoral vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle under
 fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance.  A 0.018 wire was placed through the
 needle into the femoral vein with its tip terminating in the right atrium.  A
 small incision was made over the needle and the needle was removed.  A 4.5
 French micropuncture sheath was then placed over the wire and the wire and
 inner dilator were then removed.  A wire was then placed through this sheath
 and into the right femoral vein.  A subcutaneous tunnel was created in the
 right upper thigh using local lidocaine with epinephrine and blunt dissection
 extending into the right femoral vein puncture site.  A 50-cm hemodialysis
 catheter was then placed through the tunnel following sequential dilation of
 the puncture site.  A peel-away sheath was placed into the right femoral vein
 with its tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  The wire and sheath were
 removed.  The catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath with the
 tip terminating at the right cavoatrial junction.  Both ports of the catheter
 flushed and aspirated easily.  Both ports were capped.  The new tunnel site
 was secured using two non-absorbable 0 silk sutures.  Sterile dressings were
 applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

 Moderate sedation was provided by administering moderate sedation with 75 mcg
 of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 1
 hour and 35 minutes.  The patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously
 monitored during this time.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Successful placement of tunneled right femoral vein catheter measuring 50
 cm tip-to-cuff with the hemodialysis catheter tip terminating at the junction
 of the IVC and the right atrium.  The line is ready for use.
 2.  Occluded SVC with multiple venous collaterals.  Right internal jugular
 vein occluded. Marked narrowing of a long segment of the left brachiocephalic
 vein.

 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.

 INDICATION:  Status post coronary artery bypass surgery.

 FINDINGS:  Various devices have been removed in the interval with residual
 right internal jugular vascular sheath remaining in place.  No pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal contours appear slightly more widened than on the prior
 study, possibly due to accentuation by apical lordotic projection, but
 attention to this on a followup radiograph with standard positioning and
 projection is suggested.  Persistent left lower lobe collapse and development
 of a small left pleural effusion.  Minor linear atelectasis persists in right
 perihilar region.

 PROCEDURE:  CTA chest with and without contrast and reconstructions.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  54-year-old woman with cirrhosis and hemodialysis.  New
 embolic CVA, as well as PFO and right heart strain on echo.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained at full expiration
 using a low-dose technique without contrast followed by a full full-dose
 technique at full inspiration after a rapid bolus of 100 mL Optiray contrast
 with multiplanar reformats.

 No previous CT pulmonary angiogram was available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  There is a tiny subsegmental filling defect in the left lower lobe
 (3:46), consistent with a small pulmonary embolism.
 No aortic dissection or aneurysm.
 The heart is markedly enlarged and there is enlargement of the pulmonary
 artery which is associated with tortuosity of the subsegmental pulmonary
 arteries and distal tapering.  There is also evidence of right heart strain
 with bowing of the intraventricular septum into the left ventricle and
 enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle.  A hemodialysis catheter
 passes through the right side of the heart with its tip in the distal IVC. No
 pericardial effusion.

 Left upper and lower lobe atelectasis is noted, the lungs are otherwise clear.
 Airways are widely patent to the subsegmental levels.

 HISTORY:  70-year-old with history of gallstone pancreatitis status post
 laparotomy.  Concern for abdominal source of infection given persistent
 fevers.

 COMPARISON:  [**2113-7-17**]

 TECHNIQUE:  CT through the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed after
 administration of oral contrast and 100 cc of IV contrast.  Multiplanar
 reformats were performed.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:  Endotracheal tube ends in the mid thoracic trachea.  There are right
 greater than left airspace opacities with air bronchograms, likely atelectasis
 . There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Some calcified mediastinal
 lymph nodes are noted, likely related to prior granulomatous infection.  There
 are dense coronary artery calcifications.  The heart size is normal.

 ABDOMEN:  Again seen are numerous hypodensities in the liver, many of which
 are too small to characterize but they may represent cysts.  The portal vein
 appears patent.  There is cholelithiasis.

 There has been interval enlargement in the peripancreatic fluid collection
 which currently measures roughly 19 x 7 cm.  However, this does extend
 laterally to the splenic hilum as well as inferiorly along the small bowel
 mesentery as well.  This demonstrates new internal foci of gas, suspicious for
 infection.  There is some residual enhancing pancreatic parenchyma in the tail
 and a small amount of head, but the bulk of the body of the pancreas does not
 demonstrate normal enhancement consistent with necrotizing pancreatitis. The
 splenic artery and vein appear patent.  There is no splenic artery
 pseudoaneurysm.  The SMV is also patent.

 The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.

 There is a gastrostomy tube with tip extending into the jejunum.  There is no
 evidence of bowel obstruction.  There is stranding and numerous lymph nodes
 are seen in the small bowel mesentery, likely related to the adjacent
 inflammatory process.

 PELVIS: The entire colon demonstrates a large amount of fluid within it, with
 no bowel wall thickening. There is a left femoral central venous catheter, tip
 of which terminates in the intrahepatic IVC. There is an open anterior
 abdominal wound with a wound VAC in place.  The pelvic bowel loops demonstrate
 normal caliber. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  A Foley is seen within
 the bladder. There is degenerative disc disease of the spine.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Necrotizing pancreatitis with interval increase in the peripancreatic
 fluid collection as described.  This demonstrates internal foci of gas,
 suspicious for infection.

 2.  Fluid filled colon which can be seen in colitis such as C. difficile.

 3.  Cholelithiasis.

 PROCEDURE:  Conversion of temporary HD line to tunneled HD line.

 HISTORY:  54-year-old woman with endstage liver disease and Hepatorenal
 syndrome, on hemodialysis with temporary catheter.  Request to convert this to
 a tunneled hemodialysis line.

 CLINICIANS:  Procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 547**] [**Name (STitle) 291**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
 and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1451**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 478**].  The attending radiologist was present throughout the
 procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering 25 mcg of
 fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed.  During this time, the patient's hemodynamic
 parameters were continuously monitored.  Local anesthesia was also achieved
 using 1% lidocaine.

 FINDINGS:  Written, informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure, and
 a pre-procedure timeout was performed upon arrival in the angiography suite.
 The skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Both ports of
 the existing temporary dialysis catheter were aspirated.  The existing HD
 catheter was measuring 17 cm.  After lidocaine infiltration, a subcutaneous
 tunnel was made over the right anterior chest wall measuring about 5 cm.  A
 new double-lumen 19 cm tip-to-cuff Angiodynamics hemodialysis catheter was
 selected and passed through the tunnel exiting at the pre-existing catheter in
 the neck.  A Glidewire was passed through the pre-existing catheter with the
 tip terminating in the IVC confirmed under fluoroscopic guidance.  The
 previous catheter was removed, and a peel-away sheath was introduced over the
 Glidewire.  A new HD catheter was introduced through the peel-away sheath and
 the sheath removed.  Final confirmation was obtained with fluoroscopy
 demonstrating the new dialysis catheter to be terminating within the right
 atrium.  The venous access site was sutured using 2-0 Vicryl stitch.  The
 dialysis catheter was secured to the chest wall using 0 Vicryl sutures.  Both
 ports of the catheter were aspirated and flushed with saline.  Dry sterile
 dressings were applied to both sites.  The patient tolerated the procedure

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 INDICATION:  Gallstone pancreatitis, complicated hospital course, evaluation
 for pneumonia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2113-8-2**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 minimally decreased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, with
 large left ventricle.  Unchanged position of the tracheostomy tube and the
 left-sided central venous access line.  The transparency of the lung
 parenchyma is also unchanged, retrocardiac atelectasis, small blunting of the
 left costophrenic sinus, presumably due to a small pleural effusion.  No newly
 occurred focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.  No pulmonary
 edema.

 HISTORY:  65-year-old female patient with endoscopic CABG.  Study to evaluate
 for pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or tamponade.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph is compared to prior examination
 from [**2113-8-2**].

 FINDINGS:  An ET tube is 3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube terminates in the
 stomach.  A left chest tube terminates apically and projects over the left
 hemithorax.  Slight haziness in the left hemithorax may be related to post-
 surgical change.  There is mild linear atelectasis in the right middle lung.
 No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The heart is top normal in size. No
 acute abnormalities in surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures. Lack of
 sternotomy wires is consistent with endoscopic approach.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or tamponade.

 Above findings were discussed with team via pager #[**Numeric Identifier 240**] at the time of this

 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEW, CHEST:  There are large bilateral pleural effusions,
 unchanged on the left and larger on the right.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is retrocardiac opacity which could reflect a combination
 of atelectasis and effusion.  A concomitant infection in this region cannot be
 excluded.  There is mild blurring of the perihilar vasculature and apical
 recruitment, suggesting mild volume overload.  There is aortic arch
 calcification and descending aortic calcification.  There is diffuse
 demineralization. There is kyphotic deformity of the thoracic chest wall.
 There is apparent deviation of the trachea, leftwards, which is not noted on
 prior examination and could be positional.

 IMPRESSION:

 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright chest x-ray.

 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral from [**2129-7-12**].

 FINDINGS:  Since [**2129-7-12**], following right VATS, two right apical and
 one right basal chest tube have been placed.  A pocket of subcutaneous
 emphysema in the right inferolateral chest wall at the insertion site of the
 chest tube may communicate with adjacent small pneumothorax at the right base.
 A new small pleural effusion is collected in the right apex with associated
 atelectasis. Small pleural effusions at both bases are Unchanged.

 The endotracheal tube terminates about 5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube
 ends at the GE junction and and would need to be be advanced 7 cm to move all
 the sideports into the stomach . The ediastinum, hila, and heart are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  New small right basilar pneumothorax and apical  pleural
 effusion.  NG tube should be advanced by 7 cm.

 the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the mid esophagus and appears to be coiled
 in the oropharynx.

 The lung volumes remain low with bibasilar opacities consistent with areas of
 consolidation and accompanying pleural effusion.  Mild volume overload cannot
 be excluded.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-28**], the monitoring and support

 reflect a combination of an infectious pneumonia and pulmonary edema, though
 evolving ARDS could also be possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are somewhat less prominent, though this may
 merely reflect the more upright position of the patient.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST FROM [**2113-7-1**]

 INDICATION:  Gallstone pancreatitis

 [**Hospital1 11**] Emergency Department requesting second read interpretation for CT
 obtained at [**Hospital 7712**] hospital.  No formal read is available at this time.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast,
 including multiplanar reformations.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The heart is moderately enlarged, and
 there are moderate three-vessel coronary artery calcifications.  There is no
 pericardial effusion.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the
 visualized portions of the chest.  There is a small right pleural effusion.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Two small pulmonary nodules
 are seen at the right lung base, including 3 mm nodule (2, 9) and adjacent 4-
 mm nodule (2, 8).

 Liver contour is normal.  There is no biliary ductal dilatation.  Multiple
 small well-circumscribed hypoattenuating foci are seen throughout the liver.
 The largest of these lesions measures up to 2.2 cm in the inferior right lobe
 of the liver, (2, 44), and has attenuation characteristics consistent with a
 simple cyst.  Other lesions are too small to definitively characterize.
 Multiple calcified gallstones are present within the gallbladder lumen, but
 the gallbladder itself is not distended, and there is no pericholecystic
 fluid, or gallbladder wall thickening.

 The pancreas is markedly edematous, with moderately severe peripancreatic
 stranding, which extends into the right anterior pararenal space, and
 abdominal mesentery.  Without intravenous contrast, the degree of pancreatic
 parenchymal enhancement cannot be assessed, nor can vascular patency be
 determined.  However, there is no sign of complication related to
 pancreatitis, such as pseudocyst, or other discrete fluid collection.

 The spleen is normal.  Kidneys have normal non-contrast appearance. Incidental
 note is made of retro-aortic left renal vein.  Abdominal aorta is normal in
 caliber and contour, with mild atherosclerotic calcification at the
 bifurcation.  There is no free intraperitoneal air.  There is no
                                                             (Over)

 pathologically enlarged intra-abdominal lymph node.

 CT PELVIS:  Pelvic loops of large and small bowel are normal.  Genitourinary
 structures are normal.  There are moderate bilateral fat-containing inguinal
 hernias.  There is no free pelvic fluid or abnormal pelvic or inguinal
 lymphadenopathy.

 There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy.  There are multiple old
 healed right rib fractures.  Moderate degenerative changes are seen throughout
 the visualized spine, including DISH changes in the thoracic spine.  The
 T-[**11-16**] intervertebral disc is partially calcified.  Left hip degenerative
 changes are moderately severe.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Acute pancreatitis. No definite signs of complicated pancreatitis are seen,
 though evaluation is limited by non- contrast scan technique.

 2) Cholelithiasis.

 3) No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation identified. An MRCP can
 be performed if further evaluation of the biliary tree is desired.

 Dialysis catheter placement

 INDICATION:  Renal failure, needs dialysis.

 Details of the procedure and possible complications were explained to the
 patient's proxy and informed consent was obtained.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] was performing the procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left internal
 jugular vein was localized with ultrasound and accessed with a micropuncture
 set under direct ultrasound guidance.  A micropuncture sheath was then removed
 over the wire and the tract dilated with serial dilators.  A dual-lumen
 temporary dialysis catheter was then placed over the wire with its tip
 positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire was removed.  The
 catheter was secured to the skin and a sterile dressing applied over it.

 Position of the catheter was confirmed by chest x-ray in one view.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided dual-lumen
 temporary dialysis catheter placement via the left internal jugular venous
 approach with the tip positioned in SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST CT, [**6-7**]

 HISTORY:  Right hilar adenopathy questioned on chest radiograph.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without
 intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 136**], reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick
 axial and 5-mm thick coronal and paramedian sagittal images.

 FINDINGS:  Right hilar prominence on chest radiographs is due to enlargement
 of pulmonary arteries, the right and left are each 3.2 cm, although the main
 pulmonary artery is normal caliber.  Atherosclerotic calcification is present
 in the left anterior descending and proximal circumflex branches, and at
 multiple locations in the right coronary artery and posterior descending
 branch, but not in the ascending aorta.  Moderately extensive dystrophic
 calcification is also present in the aortic valve and mitral annulus.  The
 former is more likely to be hemodynamically significant.

 There is no hilar adenopathy.  With the exception of 10-mm wide right
 paraesophageal lymph node, 2:29, mediastinal nodes are not pathologically
 enlarged and there is no pleural or pericardial abnormality. Subpleural
 opacity in the dependent portions of both lungs, particularly right lung base,
 is more readily explained by atelectasis than interstitial lung disease. There
 is no lung lesion concerning for malignancy.

 This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note the
 absence of adrenal mass.  The patient has had cholecystectomy.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No hilar adenopathy.  Possible pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 2.  Interstitial lung disease unlikely.
 3.  Heavy atherosclerotic calcification of coronary arteries and dystrophic
 calcification of the aortic valve and mitral annulus.  Calcific aortic
 stenosis should be considered.
 4.  Ascending thoracic aorta not calcified above the annulus.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected superimposed pneumonia in the patient with
 H1N1 virus.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2143-7-30**] obtained at 03:34
 a.m.

 The widespread areas of consolidation have slightly worsened in this short
 interval in particular in the right lower lung.  The rest of extensive
 involvement of the lungs is unchanged.  The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the
 carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The left central venous line tip
 is at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC.

 Although no overt pneumothorax is demonstrated a lucent line adjacent to the
 right hemidiaphragm is present and might represent summation of shadows or
 small amount of pneumothorax, attention to this area on the subsequent studies
 is recommended.

 HISTORY:  65-year-old male treated for H1N1 influenza A and C. difficile
 colitis with persistent fever, rising leukocytosis, and elevated pancreatic
 enzymes.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs today.  CT torso, [**2143-8-4**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after oral and
 Optiray IV contrast with multiplanar reformats.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Compared to the prior CT, multifocal
 airspace consolidation and reticular interstitial thickening involving all
 pulmonary lobes persist but have improved.  The pleural effusions have
 resolved.  Numerous mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are now slightly
 smaller.  A small soft tissue density near the bifurcation of right lower lobe
 segmental pulmonary arteries, is slightly smaller compared to the prior CT. As
 before it is difficult to determine if this is within or adjacent to the
 pulmonary artery as there is airspace and interstitial opacity in this region.
 Coronary artery calcifications are redemonstrated. A left internal jugular
 venous catheter terminates in the SVC.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Nasogastric tube tip is in the stomach. A
 small subcentimeter hypodensity of the posterior right hepatic lobe is
 slightly more conspicuous on today's examination but too small to
 characterize.  The gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, spleen, splenule,
 kidneys, and small bowel are unremarkable.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is collapsed.  Liquid
 stool is present within the rectosigmoid drained by a rectal tube.  There are
 bilateral fat- containing inguinal hernias. Prostate and seminal vesicles are

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  65-year-old man with pneumonia and fever.

 COMPARISONS:  No prior CT imaging.  Ultrasound from the prior day and chest
 radiography from the same day.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 with oral and intravenous contrast and sagittal and coronal reformations were
 also performed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple enlarged mediastinal
 lymph nodes, the largest being a right tracheal lymph node measuring 21 x 17
 mm in axial dimensions.  Smaller hilar lymph nodes are also present.  Some of
 these are slightly enlarged by size criteria, but most are not.  The
 adenopathy is most likely reactive. There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions.

 Multifocal consolidations are consistent with bronchopneumonia including some
 areas with complete sparing.  Early fibrotic changes including bronchiolar
 ectasia are present in the periphery of some of the consolidative opacities.

 The study was not performed as a CT angiogram, but some of the images suggest
 a filling defect in a segmental branch of the right lower lobe pulmonary
 arterial vasculature.  No other suspicious foci are demonstrated, but
 evaluation is quite limited because of superimposed opacities and faint
 opacification of arteries.

 Coronary artery and mitral valvular calcifications are present.  The patient
 is intubated. A left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at
 the cavoatrial junction.  A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The gallbladder is non-distended and
 demonstrates no wall thickening.  A gradient of density within the gallbladder
 reflects sludge seen on ultrasound images of the same day.  A hemangioma
 visualized on that study probably corresponds to a 10 mm diameter hypodense
 area in the posterior right lobe of the liver.  The spleen is mildly prominent

 The stomach and small bowel are within normal limits. The adrenal glands,
 kidneys, and pancreas appear normal. There is fluid throughout the colon but

 diverticulosis.  Several mildly prominent bilateral subcentimeter inguinal
 lymph nodes show fatty hila suggesting benignity.  There are no enlarged
 abdominal or pelvic nodes.

 Thus, the densities at the lung bases are most consistent with atelectasis.
 The tip of the ETT is above the clavicular heads.

 INDICATION:  70-year-old male with new subclavian central venous catheter.
 Evaluate position.

 Single AP chest radiograph compared to 11 hours prior shows new right
 subclavian central venous catheter coursing up the ipsilateral internal
 jugular vein.  The previously placed bilateral internal jugular central venous
 catheter remain in stable position.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube
 terminates at the inferior margin of the clavicle.  The lung volumes are low
 with subsequent bibasilar atelectasis. There are probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal contour is poorly assessed. Apparent
 widening of the mediastinum is unchanged and likely related to low lung
 volumes and projection given that it was normal on [**2113-7-1**].

 IMPRESSION:  New right subclavian central venous catheter courses up the
 ipsilateral internal jugular vein. Discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 29086**].

 HISTORY:  85-year-old woman with fever and shortness of breath status post
 fall.

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There is consolidation in the right lower lobe.  There is a large
 right pleural effusion with predomnantly a subpulmonic distribution.  There is
 a small left pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess
 but is grossly stable. No pneumothorax is noted. There are innumerable
 surgical clips along the left lateral border of the lower thoracic spine
 related to prior surgery and would recommend clinical correlation.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 2.  Consolidation in the right lower lung consistent with lobar pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  New pneumonia.

 REFERENCE EXAM:  [**7-28**].

 FINDINGS:  The right subclavian line has been removed.  There continues to be
 a right IJ line and left subclavian line.  The right upper lobe has improved
 aeration compared to the film from yesterday; however, bilateral lower lobes
 continue to show volume loss and effusion.  There is increased opacity in the
 right lower lung suggesting a new area of consolidation in that region.  Old
 right rib fractures are again seen.

 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobes volume loss/infiltrate/effusions with the
 right lower lobe infiltrate increased compared to prior.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**8-23**], the left central catheter has
 been repositioned so that the tip lies in the region of the mid-to-lower
 portion of the SVC.  Tracheostomy tube and right IJ catheter remain in place.
 The cardiac silhouette is again at the upper limits of normal in size.
 Atelectatic changes are seen at both bases with continued elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.

 Some ill-defined, primarily reticular opacifications are seen in the right mid
 to upper lung zones.  These most likely represent residual fibrous healing
 from the previous right upper lobe pneumonia.

 A portable AP upright chest radiograph was compared to [**2143-8-18**].  There has
 been interval development of multiple patchy opacities at the left lung base
 concerning for aspiration, developing infection or atelectasis.  Tracheostomy
 tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina, as before.  A right central venous
 catheter tip projects just above the cavoatrial junction.  Relative elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left is unchanged.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are essentially stable.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of multiple patchy opacities at the left
 lung base concerning for infection or aspiration.  However, given the overall
 lung volumes, findings could also represent atelectasis and clinical
 correlation is recommended.

 with sepsis and fever.

 STUDY:  Neck CT with contrast.  Please note that an angled scan was also
 performed to better image areas obscured initially by metallic streak artifact
 emanating from non-removable dental hardware.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  There is a right subclavian line as well
 as a right jugular line.  Retropharyngeal tissues and parotid glands are
 unremarkable.  The neck soft tissue shows no fluid collection or subcutaneous
 emphysema.  The cervical esophagus is distended by radiopaque material
 presumably ingested radiographic contrast, related to the concurrent CT torso.
 There is no discrete leak nor is there any extraluminal contrast noted.  There
 are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than the right with associated
 relaxation atelectasis.  For further evaluation of the lungs, see separate
 report of the concurrent chest CTA.

 IMPRESSION:  No sign of deep space infection, fluid collection or abscess in
 the soft tissues of the neck.

 Portable semi-upright radiograph was compared to [**2135-6-21**] (preoperative
 study).

 The patient is after mini-CABG operation that does not require sternotomy. The
 left chest tube is in place with no evidence of left pneumothorax.  The right
 internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.  There is left mid
 lung peripheral opacity most likely consistent with post-surgical hematoma
 unlikley aspiration. Basal retrocardiac opacity is demonstrated on the left as
 well, which also may be related to postsurgical atelectasis.  Close attention
 to this area on the subsequent radiograph is recommended.  There is no
 evidence of appreciable pleural effusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Continuous axial slices were obtained from the base of the neck
 down to the scrotum with IV and oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reconstructions of the chest were obtained.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST:
 An endotracheal tube is seen in the trachea ending 4 cm above the carina.

 The pulmonary arteries and aorta appear normal with no evidence of any filling
 defects.  There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  The heart appears
 normal in size.

 There is pneumonia in the right lower lobe. Atelectasis is seen in the left
 lower lobe.  There is left greater than right pleural effusion.  There are
 some small calcifications in the lung bases.  There is also a calcification in
 the subcarinal lymph node which along with the calcification in the lung bases
 indicate prior granulomatous disease.  There are old healed right rib
 fractures.

 An 18-mm nodule is seen in the left thyroid lobe which is heterogenous in
 appearance.  If this has not been evaluated in the past and there are no
 comparison available then a non-emergent ultrasound is suggested for further
 evaluation.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST:
 There appear to be multiple round hypodense cystic lesion in the liver which
 most likely represent benign cyst or hamartomas.  There is a ill-defined
 hypoattenuating tubular lesion in the lateral aspect of segment II of the left
 lobe of the liver which might possibly represent local biliary dilatation.
 There has been no change in the lesion seen in the past three weeks.  Once the
 patient's condition is improved if clinically warranted an MRCP is suggested
 for evaluation of this lesion.  The spleen is normal in appearance and the

 splenic vein is patent.

 Compared to the prior there is an increase in the peripancreatic fluid and the
 pancreas appears swollen.  There is a large area of the entire neck and
 superior head without enhancement consistent with pancreatic necrosis.  Also
 at the left aspect of the body and the tail is a 2.5-cm hypoenhancing region
 also consistent with pancreatic necrosis.  There is a large surrounding
 peripancreatic phlegmonous fluid collection, increased markedly since the
 prior CT.  There may be a small amount of hemorrhagic necrosis but no large
 hemorrhage.  No gas in the collection.  Organizing fluid collections and fat
 stranding are seen along the right anterior pararenal space and stranding
 without fluid collection is seen along the left anterior pararenal space.
 Subcutaneous flank edema is also seen.

 There is no renal excretion of contrast from neck CT 19 minutes after
 administration consistent with known renal insufficiency for which the patient
 is receiving CVVH dialysis.

 A gastrojejunal tube is seen ending past the ligament of Treitz.  The small
 and large bowel appeared normal. No retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal
 hemorrhage is seen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:
 A rectal tube and Foley catheter are seen ending in the rectum and bladder
 respectively.  Bilateral hydroceles are visible.  There is fusion of the
 sacroiliac joints raises the question of HLA-B27 arthropathy, but could be
 from  diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) as is seen along the
 anterior aspect of the body of the spinal vertebrae.  The rectum and sigmoid
 colon appeared normal without evidence of any diverticula.

 The bladder appears normal with no masses, blood or stone visible.  Spleen
 appears normal in size.  There is no evidence of any pelvic lymphadenopathy.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and fusion of
 the sacroiliac joints are seen as described above. No lytic or sclerotic bone
 findings of concern.

 VESSELS:  The abdominal and pelvic vessels appear normal.  There is mild
 amount of aortic calcification visible in the thorax and abdomen.

 INDICATION: Malposition of indwelling PICC line.

 The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3853**] performed the procedure under the supervision of Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 63**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3010**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a guidewire was
 advanced through the indwelling left arm PICC line, and subsequently into the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The old PICC line was then removed and a
 peel-away sheath was then placed over the guidewire.  A new double lumen PICC
 line measuring 47 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of
 the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a new
 5 French double lumen PICC line.  Final internal length is 47 cm, with the tip
 positioned in the SVC.  The line is ready to use.

 AP CHEST, 5:37 P.M., [**2113-7-17**]

 HISTORY:  Upper GI bleed.  Hemoptysis.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-7**] through [**7-17**], 5:22 a.m.:

 Tip of the right subclavian line projects over the low SVC.  Right internal
 jugular line tip is at the lower margin of the right clavicle, probably still
 in the brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
 Mediastinal vascular engorgement and peribronchial cuffing suggest mild
 cardiac decompensation.  Large cardiac silhouette is longstanding.  Bilateral
 consolidation at the lung bases, left greater than right, has been a constant
 feature for least a week.  Whether this is atelectasis alone or due to
 aspiration with the possibility of superinfection is radiographically
 indeterminate but the stability argues against active infection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric CT acquisitions over the entire thorax in inspiration,
 no administration of intravenous contrast material, multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion, more extensive right-sided
 pleural effusion with a maximum diameter of 3 cm.  The dorsal parts of the
 right lower lobe are completely collapsed, the more ventral parts show
 moderate consolidations with numerous air bronchograms.  A small amount of
 pleural effusion extends into the right major fissure.  The anterior parts of
 the right lung are normal.  On the left, there is minimal dorsal atelectasis
 adjacent to the effusion.  Focal parenchymal opacities in the left lung are
 not seen.  Moderate cardiomegaly, extensive coronary calcifications, no
 evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement.

 Post-surgical clips in the left upper abdomen.

 The quality of the examination is limited by numerous respiratory motion
 artifacts.

 IMPRESSION:  Extensive right lower lobe consolidation and opacity, strongly
 suggesting pneumonia, with an accompanying moderate reactive pleural effusion.
 Minimal effusion on the left, with adjacent area of atelectasis.

 No evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the other parts of the
 lung are unremarkable, taking the multiple motion artifacts into
 consideration.
 No evidence of lymphadenopathy, coronary calcifications, clips in the left

 INDICATION:  65-year-old male with renal failure.

 RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**], the
 Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient
 explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was placed
 supine on angiography table and the right neck was prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed.

 Using sterile technique, local anesthesia and ultrasound guidance, access was
 obtained into the right internal jugular vein.  Hard copies of ultrasound
 images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous
 access.  A 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the needle into the SVC under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a micropuncture
 sheath.

 The wire and the inner dilator of the sheath were removed and a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**]
 wire was advanced through the sheath into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
 The puncture site was progressively dilated with 12 and 14 French dilators.  A
 double-lumen temporary hemodialysis catheter was advanced over the wire with
 the tip positioned within the right atrium.  The wire was removed and the
 catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk sutures and a sterile dressing
 was applied.  Both lumens were flushed and capped.

 Final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrates the tip of the catheter
 located within the right atrium.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter
 measuring 15 cm in length through the right internal jugular venous approach.
 The catheter is ready to use.

 HISTORY:  45-year-old male with history of mini-CABG, status post chest tube
 removal.

 A portable AP upright chest radiograph is compared to [**2135-6-28**].  There has been
 removal of the left chest tube and a new small apical pneumothorax is now
 visible. A small amount of lucency projecting over the left heart border may
 also represent pneumothorax.  There has also been interval removal of a right
 internal jugular central line.  There has been decrease in the amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall tissues.  Increasing
 retrocardiac density, likely representing a combination of atelectasis and
 effusion, is mildly worse compared to the prior study. A small left pleural

 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.

 INDICATION:  New line placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  New left subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the distal left
 brachiocephalic vein approximately 1 cm from the confluence with the superior
 vena cava.  No pneumothorax.  Other indwelling devices are unchanged in
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged allowing for positional
 differences between the studies.  Slight improvement in aeration at the lung
 bases with residual areas of consolidation, atelectasis and pleural effusions,
 right greater than left.  Apparently new hazy opacity in right upper lobe,
 which is of uncertain etiology but could reflect asymmetric edema, focal
 aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia.  Followup radiographs would be
 helpful in this regard.

 COMPARISON:  [**2152-6-7**].

 HISTORY:  73-year-old male status post emergent repair of the ascending aorta,
 evaluate for pneumonia or pleural effusion/clot and abscess in left IJ.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images of the chest were obtained.  IV
 contrast was administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed.

 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post ascending aortic repair with multiple
 surgical clips seen in the mediastinum. Small amount of stranding is
 consistent with postoperative change with no concerning focal fluid
 collections identified. Calcifications of the coronary arteries and aortic
 valve is noted. Calcification of the mitral valve is also identified. There is
 a small pericardial effusion measuring approximately 8 mm. Calcifications of
 the arch of the aorta are noted.  Again identified is enlargement of the right
 and left pulmonary arteries, unchanged. There is no evidence of axillary,
 hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent to the
 subsegmental level.

 Scattered patchy ground-glass opacities are seen throughout both lungs, mostly
 in the left upper lobe and right middle lobe.  Bibasilar atelectasis is also
 noted.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  New scattered ground-glass patchy opacities throughout both lungs.
 Differential diagnosis includes infection or aspiration.

 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 451**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], and [**Doctor Last Name 23**], the attending radiologist who
 supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  The procedure was explained to the patient.  A pre-procedural
 timeout was performed, confirming the patient's identity using 3 patient
 identifiers, as well as the procedure to be performed.  Using sterile
 technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guidewire and a
 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 42 cm in length was then placed
 through the peel-away sheath under fluoroscopic guidance with its tip
 positioned in the SVC.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were
 then removed.  The catheter was secured to the skin, both lumens flushed and
 capped, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient's pre-existing left arm PICC was then removed and the tip sent for
 culture.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 COMPARISON:  CT from [**2173-2-23**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained through the chest before
 and after the uneventful administration of 100 cc of Optiray intravenously.
 Enteric contrast was not administered.  Multiplanar reformats were derived.

 FINDINGS:  The visualized thyroid is unremarkable.  Left axillary lymph nodes
 measured to 1 cm, similar to prior.

 There are prominent prevascular nodes, similar to prior.  An AP window node
 previously measuring 9 mm today is unchanged.  An aortocaval node in the
 anterior mediastinum measures 9 mm, 7 before.  A right paratracheal node
 previously measuring 1 cm today measures 1.3 cm.  Right hilar adenopathy is
 difficult to compare with prior given the lack of contrast.  Subcarinal node
 measures 2.5 x 1.5 cm, similar to prior.  The pulmonary artery measures 3.6
 cm, enlarged.  There is no pulmonary embolus.  The thoracic aorta is mildly
 dilated at the distal arch, measuring up to 3.7 cm.  There is no aortic
 dissection.  There are vascular, including coronary artery calcifications.
 The heart appears enlarged.  In the left atrial appendage there is a soft
 tissue density (series 3, image 39) that may represent wall or throombus.
 There is no pericardial effusion.  The esophagus appears normal.

 Central airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi.  There is
 ground-glass opacification in a central perihilar distribution, as before,

 with associated smoothly thickened intra- and inter-lobular septa.  There are
 increased bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions, simple in
 attenuation.

 This study is not optimized to evaluate the abdomen.  Within this limitation,
 the visualized liver, spleen and stomach appear normal.  There is no
 suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 are seen in the spine.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No pulmonary embolus.  No aortic dissection.

 2.  Diffuse central perihilar ground-glass opacification, bilateral pleural
 effusions, non-bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery
 hypertension is most consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
 Differential diagnosis, however, does include interstitial pneumonia such as
 PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] well as pulmonary hemorrhage, drug hypersensitivity, sarcoid and
 alveolar proteinosis although these seem less likely.  Recommend rescan after
 treatment to ensure no underlying process.

 3.  Vascular including dense coronary artery calcifications.

 4.  Appparent thickening of left atrial appendage may artifactual due to wall
 apposition or could represent thrombus.  Correlation with clinical history and
 echocardiogram suggested.

 INDICATION:  Evaluation of interval change.

 COMPARISON:  [**2165-9-15**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The lung volumes are smaller.  As a consequence, there
 is increased crowding of the basal lung structures.  Slight increase of
 pulmonary fluid cannot be excluded.  Also, the presence of small pleural
 effusions cannot be excluded.  Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  No evidence of
 focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post fall.

 COMPARISON: C-spine CT from from [**2116-2-19**].

 TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the cervical spine were obtained without
 administration of IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 also submitted for interpretation.

 FINDINGS:

 There is minimal vertebral body height loss at C3-C6, likely degenerative.  No
 acute fracture or dislocation is seen.  There is anterior fusion of C4-C6 as
 well as fusion of the facet joints of the upper visualized thoracic spine
 vertebra.  Disc osteophyte formation at C2-C7 causes mild spinal canal
 stenosis.  CT cannot evaluate integrity of the cord or ligaments and an MRI
 can be obtained in case of clinical concern for cord injury.  Prevertebral
 soft tissues are not thickened.  Again seen there is a 5.0 x 4.7 cm mass
 within the left thyroid gland, which contains areas of punctate calcification,
 partially imaged on prior exam.  There is mild displacement of the trachea to
 the right caused by this mass.  There is a 1-cm ill-defined ground- glass left
 upper lobe nodule.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. No fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine. CT cannot evaluate
 integrity of the cord or ligaments and an MRI can be obtained in case of
 clinical concern for cord injury.

 2. Left thyroid lobe mass, partially imaged on prior C-spine CT.  Non-
 emergent ultrasound can be obtained for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epidural abscess, now with Gram-negative rod bacteremia, question of
 source.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2121-1-10**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images were acquired through the torso following
 administration of 130 cc of intravenous Optiray contrast.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformatted images were also reviewed.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.
 A small amount of subcutaneous gas and soft tissue swelling is noted in the
 soft tissues of the anterior neck at the upper. Airways are patent to
 subsegmental levels bilaterally.

 Bibasilar consolidations are noted, with subjacent small pleural effusions.
 Otherwise, the lungs are notable for patchy areas of ground-glass opacity as
 well as mild interlobular septal thickening, consistent with possible mild
 volume overload.

 The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is no mediastinal or
 axillary lymphadenopathy. An esophageal tube terminates with the tip just
 distal to the gastroesophageal junction, and this tube could be advanced
 somewhat if clinically indicated.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The stomach, duodenum, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands are unremarkable.  A hepatic hypodensity in segment VIII is
 incompletely characterized on this single phase of contrast, though unchanged
 since [**2120-12-16**] at which time it appeared consistent with a hemangioma.

 Note is made of mild periportal edema as well as a small amount of fluid
 surrounding the gallbladder, which otherwise appears unremarkable.  The
 kidneys contain focal hypodensities bilaterally, some of which are too small
 to characterize, others of which, such as at the right lower pole, are

 INDICATION:  59-year-old man with Staph aureus sepsis and multiple abscesses,
 seen on thoracic spine CT on a prior study.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-enhanced axial MDCT images of the chest were obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:

 LUNG PARENCHYMA:  There are multiple bilateral cavitary lung lesions
 predominantly in the left upper lobe, the largest measuring 23 x 2 mm (4:65),
 21 x 22 mm (4:30), 12 x 12 mm (4:112), 10 x 7 mm (4:57), 8 x 7 mm (4:100), 4 x
 8 mm (4:65) and 23 x 19 mm (4:136).  There is a 13 x 17 mm measuring cavitated
 lesion in the right upper lobe (4:82).

 AIRWAYS:  Almost complete opacification of the right lower lobe, consistent
 with atelectasis.  There is complete obliteration of at least two of the
 segmental bronchi in the right lower lobe.  There is moderate amount of airway
 secretions in the trachea (4:75).

 LYMPHADENOPATHY:  There are multiple borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph
 nodes located in the upper paratracheal, prevascular and anterior mediastinal
 lymph node regions measuring up to 9 mm in short axis.

 CARDIOVASCULAR:  There is a small pericardial effusion.  There is moderate
 aortic valve, mitral valve and aortic arch calcification of unknown clinical
 significance.

 SOFT TISSUES:  The left lobe of the thyroid is enlarged consistent with
 goiter. There is a 23 x 19 mm retroclavicular left soft tissue mass which
 might represent a lymph node or a vessel. Differentiation is not possible on
 this non- enhanced CT exam.

 BONES:  There are multiple bilateral old rib fractures, a non-healed right
 scapular fracture and degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint.
 There is a bone island in the right scapula.  There are no suspicious lytic or
 sclerotic lesions in the spine.

 UPPER ABDOMEN:

 There are multiple enlarged bilateral cystic lesions in the kidneys, most of
 them representing simple cysts, however, there are some complex cyst including
 a large 5 x 4 cm measuring complex cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney.
 Significantly distended gallbladder, filled with sludge and with three large
 rim-calcified gallstones with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 64610**] sign (vacuum air).

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  There are multiple,  cavitated lesions in both lungs, predominantly in the
 left upper lobe, measuring up to 23 x 20 mm, likely representing septic emboli
 and multiple cavitated abscesses from the known Staph aureus sepsis. The
 differential diagnosis includes cavitating metastases.

 2. Almost complete atelectasis of the right lower lobe with obliteration of at
 least two of the segmental bronchi of the right lower lobe. There is moderate
 amount of airway secretions.

 3.  Multiple borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, which are likely
 reactive in nature.

 4.  Small pericardial effusion.

 5.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures and a right non-healed scapular fracture.

 6.  Multiple bilateral renal cysts, which might represent multicystic kidney
 disease secondary to dialysis or polycystic kidney disease. Some of the cysts
 are simple, others are complex in nature and especially one large cyst in the
 left kidneys warrants correlation with ultrasound or MRI.

 7.  The gallbladder is significantly distended and filled with sludge.  There
 are at least three rim-calcified gallstones.

 STUDY AND TECHNIQUE:  CT of the torso with contrast; MDCT images of the torso
 were generated after the administration of oral contrast and 100 cc of
 Visipaque intravenous contrast; coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 generated.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2113-8-21**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  A right subclavian central line is noted with
 its tip ending in the SVC.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, greater on
 the right than the left with associated atelectasis; this represents a minimal
 change from the previous study.  There are no focal areas of consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is identified.  A tracheostomy is noted.
 The major airways are patent.  The heart is normal in size and appearance. The
 root of the aorta measures 4 cm in diameter.  No significant mediastinal,
 hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy is identified.  No soft tissue
 abnormalities are noted.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Multiple foci of well-defined, round
 hypodensity are noted throughout the liver which is unchanged from previous
 study and may represent cysts.  The previously noted wedge-shaped hypodensity
 at the periphery of the right lobe still persists and may represent hepatic
 infarct. There is no evidence of biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is fluid
 filled, decompressed, and contains a small radiopaque stone as noted on
 previous study.  The spleen is normal in size and configuration.  The kidneys
 appear normal in size and appearance and may opacify symmetrically with
 contrast material.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)

 There is a percutaneously placed drain entering from the left lateral aspect
 of the abdomen that resides in the tail with a peripancreatic fluid collection
 measures approximately 7.5 x 15 cm, which may represent a slight interval
 increase from the previous study.  The drain actually lies in the posterior
 aspect of this fluid collection and this posterior aspect of the collection
 contains more gas than on the previous study.  The anterior aspect of fluid
 collection remains slightly increased in density and likely represents clot.
 This aspect of this fluid collection also contains more gas than on the
 previous study.  This fluid collection tracks along the tail and body of the
 pancreas and even down to the level of the head of the pancreas where again
 multiple locules of gas are noted within the fluid collection.

 There continues to be diffuse fat stranding throughout the mesentry.  The
 perihepatic fluid noted on previous study is largely unchanged.  The
 percutaneous GJ tube and left-sided femoral line appear unchanged.  The
 anterior abdominal wall is open with a wound VAC applied.  Contrast is noted
 throughout the small and large intestine.  The aorta, IVC and portal vein and
 their major branches appear unremarkable.  No free air is noted in the
 abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate and rectum appear
 unremarkable. Femoral line is noted to enter from the left, no free air or
 free fluid is noted in the pelvis.  No soft tissue abnormalities are noted.

 BONE WINDOWS:  The previously noted degenerative changes of the lumbar spine
 with anterior bridging osteophytes persists.  No sclerotic or lytic lesions
 are noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Slight interval decrease in peripancreatic fluid collection; interval
 increase in peripancreatic fluid collection gas locules.

 2.  Persistent wedge-shaped hypodensity in right liver lobe, possibly
 representing hepatic infarct; multiple stable cystic hypodensities.

 3.  Persistent perihepatic fluid.

 FINDINGS:  The nasogastric tube lies below the diaphragm, however the side
 hole lies north of the esophagogastric junction.

 There is evidence of plate fixation of C6 to T1.

 There is an ET tube lying 9.4 cm above the carina.

 The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits.  There has been no
 significant change to the left lower lobe atelectasis.  Again the left
 costophrenic angle is poorly visualized, and there may be an effusion present.

 CONCLUSION:  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube.  Otherwise unchanged.

 HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male who jumped off of his boat and did not resurface
 after ingesting ethanol.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT helical acquisition was performed from the thoracic inlet to
 the pubic symphysis following the uneventful administration of intravenous
 contrast.  Multiplanar reformations were provided.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are diffuse bilateral extensive airspace
 opacities in a peribronchovascular distribution suggestive of pulmonary edema,
 likely secondary to drowning. There is also bilateral dependent opacities
 which may represent a combination of atelectasis and/or aspiration.

 The trachea and bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level.  There is no
 evidence of acute traumatic aortic injury.  The heart, aorta, and great
 vessels appear unremarkable.  There is no rib fracture or pneumothorax.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of fluid in the stomach,
 which also may be consistent with the near drowning event.  There is no
 evidence of solid organ injury, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, or perforated
 bowel.  The liver demonstrates a hypodense lesion in segment II, which is not
 fully characterized on this study, but requires further evaluation.  This
 measures 1.4 cm (2:47).  The spleen, pancreas, kidneys, appear unremarkable,
 except for a right renal cyst (2:83).  Note is made of high-density material
 in the second portion of the duodenum, which may represent ingested foreign
 body or tooth fragment (2:67, 2:66).  There is no free intra-abdominal gas or
 fluid. There is no lymphadenopathy.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A rectal catheter is seen.  Evaluation of the
 lower pelvis is suboptimal due to streak artifact from adjacent hip
 replacement prostheses.  There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy or
 pelvic fluid collection.

 Osseous structures demonstrate bilateral total hip arthroplasties.  The pelvis
 otherwise demonstrate no fracture.  There is relatively severe degenerative

 HISTORY:  Cervical fracture, rule out acute process.  Comparison is made with
 CT C-spine from one day prior.

 In the area of the known right C6 fracture , no definite evidence for
 dissection is noted, although the region of interest is limited in evaluation
 due to artifact.  Extensive parenchymal opacities are noted. Recommend
 correlation with dedicated chest imaging.


 IMPRESSION:

 Limited evaluation at the C6 fracture level due to extensive artifact. No
 convincing abnormality is seen in the course and caliber of the vertebral
 artery. However, if clinical concern persists, recommend correlation with MRA
 and fat saturated T1 weighted images.

 with coronary artery stents versus calcification.  There is no pericardial
 effusion.  Great vessels demonstrate atherosclerotic calcification but are
 normal in caliber.  High-density foci adjacent to subcarinal lymph node
 suggest prior granulomatous disease.  There is no mediastinal, hilar or
 axillary lymphadenopathy by size criteria.

 Compared to the study of [**9-7**], aeration of the lungs has improved,
 particularly at the posterior lung bases, where a small amount of dependent
 atelectasis persists.  Small pleural effusions also persist bilaterally.
 Peripheral nodular opacities (for example at the right lung base) (2:29, 31)
 were not clearly seen previously due to regions of atelectasis.  These measure
 less than 4 mm.

 In the subsegmental branches of the tracheobronchial tree supplying the
 posterior right lower lobe (2:27, 29; and 300B:45), there is a small amount of
 aerosolized material layering dependently, likely resulting in mucus plugging
 and related to aspiration.  However, there is no postobstructive atelectasis
 at this time. The remaining tracheobronchial tree is patent.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple hepatic hypodensities are unchanged.
 There has been an interval decrease in ascites throughout the abdomen, now
 small.  The gallbladder is unchanged, with layering high-density material
 consistent with gallstones.  The spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are
 grossly unremarkable.  There is no hydronephrosis or renal calculus.  In the
 stomach, there is a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube.

 Pancreatic parenchyma is again difficult to definitively visualize given the
 extensive pancreatic and peripancreatic aerosolized fluid collection extending
 through the mid abdomen.  Overall, this is largely unchanged in size measuring
 roughly 14.6 x 3.9 cm (2:64).  A percutaneous drain extends through the left
 lateral abdominal wall to terminate at the very lateral margin of this
 collection.  This drain has been retracted by approximately 7 cm since the
 prior study.  Extensive inflammatory stranding and fluid again extends
 throughout the mesentery.

 The abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic calcification but is normal
 in caliber.  Again noted is the open ventral abdominal wall wound.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Oral contrast material extends throughout the
 bowel, with no new abnormalities.  Again noted is extension of contrast
 material from the descending colon into the peripancreatic collection (2:68),
 consistent with known fistula demonstrated on [**2113-9-19**].  The sigmoid colon
 demonstrates moderate diverticulosis without diverticulitis.  There is no
 evidence of bowel obstruction.  The urinary bladder is collapsed around a
 Foley catheter.  Prostate gland is unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in
                                                             (Over)

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no new bony abnormality.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes in the spine and ossification of the anterior

 IMPRESSIONS:

 1.  New focus of aerosolized material within the bronchi supplying the
 posterior right lower lobe likely reflects aspirated material resulting in
 mucus plugging.  However, at this time there is no postobstructive atelectasis
 at the right lung base.

 2.  Extensive pancreatic and peripancreatic aerosolized fluid collection is
 unchanged in size and distribution.  Interval retraction of left lateral
 abdominal wall drain, pulled back approximately 7 cm from the prior study. The
 drain now terminates at the very lateral margin of the collection.

 3.  Re-demonstration of fistula between the descending colon and the lateral
 aspect of the peripancreatic collection.

 4.  Interval decrease in ascites.

 5.  Improved aeration at the lung bases.  Persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  59-year-old man with pneumonia, MSSA bacteremia, and now feculent
 return from OG tube.  Study to rule out small bowel obstruction or ileus.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images from lung base to the pubic symphysis
 were displayed by 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformatted images were also obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The visualized portions
 of the lungs demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions with likely atelectasis,
 though underlying consolidation or additional pathology cannot be ruled out. A
 small pericardial effusions is present. An OG tube terminates in the stomach.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST: There is significant streak artifact limiting
 evaluation of abdominal organs. However within that limitation, the liver
 appears homogeneous in density, without biliary dilatation or mass.
 Gallbladder is distended, measuring 6.7 cm in short axis, associated with four
 large gallstones.  Within limitation of current study, the gallbladder does
 not demonstrate evidence of cholecystitis. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, stomach and small bowel all appear unremarkable.  There is no fat
 stranding, abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 The kidneys are atrophic, in keeping with patient's history of end-stage renal
 disease.  There is a left renal cyst measuring 18 x 18 mm located in the
 posterior aspect of the upper pole of left kidney(2, 21).  A second renal cyst
 measuring 34 x 15 mm is seen in the middle pole of left kidney (2, 29).  A
 round area of high density (80 [**Doctor Last Name **]) located in the lower pole of the right
 kidney likely represents a hyperdense cyst although underlying tumor cannot be
 ruled out. There is scattered atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal
 aorta.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL CONTRAST:  Contrast opacification of the colon
 is achieved throughout the colon with decreasing contrast density distally,
 consistent with a fluid-filled colon and colitis.  No obstructing lesion is
 identified.  A rectal tube is in place, with intraluminal contrast layering.
 The bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.  There is
 calcification of bilateral vas deferens.

 A small fat-containing umbilical hernia is present (2, 57).  A right femoral
 catheter extends into the right iliac vein.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.  Mild
 trabecular coarsening in the posterior left iliac [**Doctor First Name 1295**] may be related to renal
 osteodystrophy. A large 13mm lytic lesion with sclerotic border adjacent to
 left SI joint (300b,38) is probably a subchondral cyst.

 Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were reviewed, confirming axial
 findings.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of small bowel obstruction or ileus.

 2. Bilateral large pleural effusions with atelectasis.  Underlying
 consolidation and other pathology cannot be ruled out.  Further evaluation
 recommended if clinically indicated.

 3. Right renal high denity region (2, 30) in a setting of end-stage renal
 disease, likely represents a hyperdense cyst, although underlying tumor cannot
 be ruled out.  Close followup with ultrasound is recommended. Two left renal
 cysts as detailed above, (2, 29), (2, 21).

 4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis on this limited
 examination.  If clinically indicated, ultrasound examination may be
 considered.

 5. Small pericardial effusion.

 6. Mild trabecular coarsening in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 1295**], likely due to renal
 osteodystrophy, and less likely represent Paget's disease.

 INDICATION:  59-year-old male with respiratory failure, hypotension, and end-
 stage renal disease.

 COMPARISON:  CXR [**2117-2-1**] at 3:37 a.m.

 BEDSIDE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST:  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 7.7 cm above the carina.  An endogastric tube terminates in the proximal
 stomach.  A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the upper
 superior vena cava.  Dense retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis
 with associated leftward cardiomediastinal shift.  Right mid-lung opacity is
 significantly more conspicuous compared to prior studies.  Small bilateral
 effusions persist, with fluid entering the oblique and minor fissures on the
 right.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multiple healed right posterior rib
 fractures are again noted.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  More confluent right mid-lung opacity, perhaps atelectatic, though
 continued attention to this region is recommended.
 2.  Persistent dense retrocardiac atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PROCEDURE:  CT chest with contrast.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  MRSA bacteremia and cavitary lung lesions with fever spike.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT chest without IV contrast.  5-mm and 1.25 mm axial slices
 were acquired with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 COMPARISON:  Previous CT [**2117-8-24**].

 FINDINGS:  There are new large bilateral pleural effusions.  Multiple well-
 marginated pulmonary lesions are again redemonstrated, some of which have
 changed in size and degree of cavitation, for example in the left upper lobe
 was 24 x 21 now measures 18 x 16 mm and in the left upper lobe was 20 mm x 22
 mm, now measures 20 x 19 mm with central cavitation.  A cluster of cavitating
 nodules in the right lower lobe are partially obscured by an overlying pleural
 effusion (3:39).  These nodules involve all lobes with the exception of the
 middle lobe.  There are no new nodules in the upper lobes, accurate assessment
 of the lower lobes is not possible due to the large pleural effusions. Within
 the central airways there are secretions extending from the lower trachea into
 the right main stem bronchus, the central and segmental airways are widely
 patent.

 Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in the upper paratracheal,
 prevascular and anterior mediastinum measure up to 8 mm, unchanged.

 The aorta and pulmonary artery are normal except to note atherosclerotic
 calcification in the aortic arch.  The heart size is mildly enlarged,
 unchanged with a small pericardial effusion, likely physiological.

 Hetrogenous enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid, which contains
 central calcification and central low density is consistent with a goiter
 is unchanged. A left central venous line tip is in the brachiocephalic vein.
 Multiple enlarged vascular collaterals in the anterior chest wall and axilla
 suggest central venous stenosis further evaluation is not possible on a non-
 contrast study.

 No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions, multiple bilateral healed rib
 fractures and a non-healed right scapular fracture is stable.  On the limited
 views of the upper abdomen,  streak artifact limits assessment, multiple renal

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Increasing moderate to large dependent bilateral pleural effusions, which
 are incompletely evaluated without intravenous contrast.
 2. Multiple cavitating lung lesions of various sizes most likely septic
 emboli, predominantly in the left upper lobe and right lower lobe.
 3. Multiple dilated vascular structures in the anterior chest wall and axilla
 could potentially reflect collaterals in setting of central venous
 obstruction, but the latter cannot be assessed for in absence of intravenous
 contrast.
 4. Left thyroid lobe goiter, unchanged.
 5.  Multiple renal cysts and calcified gallbladder stones, incompletely
 evaluated.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on [**2117-9-11**] and chest CT on [**9-9**], [**2116**].

 FINDINGS:

 SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The study is suboptimal due to patient
 motion and leftward rotation. Lines and tubes are unchanged. An NG tube is
 seen with the proximal part coiling in the oropharynx, but which traverses the
 esophagus with the distal tip in the expected location of the.  There is a
 left-sided PICC line terminating at the left brachiocephalic vein, unchanged.
 A central venous catheter is again seen extending superiorly from the inferior
 aspect of the film, terminating in the thoracic IVC or cavoatrial junction.

 Allowing for difference in technique, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged and of top limit. There is interval increase of right mid lung field
 opacity.  The right lower lobe is seen with streaky opacity, likely
 atelectasis.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Left base opacity is
 likely due to pleural effusion and overlying atelectasis; underlying
 consolidation not excluded.  There is persistent left retrocardiac and mid
 lung opacity, unchanged.  No pneumothorax is noted.  Vascular engorgement
 persists.   Multiple right rib deformities are noted.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent edema and fluid overload.  Bilateral effusions.
 2.  Interval increase of right mid lung opacity, could represent shift of
 edema/fluid distribution vs consolidation.
 3.  Persistent left retrocardiac/left base and mid lung opacities.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Endotracheal tube placement, head trauma.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2191-4-6**].

 FINDINGS:  Portable AP Frontal view of the chest.  Evaluation is limited due
 to low lung volumes. There is an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately
 5.6 cm above from the carina. There is a left-sided pacemaker device with the
 leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle.  The NG tube tip is seen
 just beyond the GE junction with sideport likely in the distal esophagus.
 Bibasilar opacities may represent sequelae of aspiration or atelectasis. There
 is no pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged. Mild hilar congestion cannot
 be excluded. The aorta is tortuous. Bones are grossly intact.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube tip in the proximal stomach. Recommend advancement.
 2.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to multiple prior studies dating
 back to [**2117-8-27**].

 The heart size is top normal, unchanged.  There is gradual worsening of left
 retrocardiac opacity consistent with worsening of atelectasis.  There is also
 in addition gradual increase in the left lower lung consolidation that might
 represent worsening infectious process as well as a combination of infection
 and pulmonary edema.  It appears to be worse compared to [**2117-9-3**].
 The right basal opacity is unchanged.  There is no significant interval
 increase in pleural effusions which are present and bilateral.  Overall
 gradual worsening of the parenchymal involvement is noted.  The known
 pulmonary nodules are difficult to see now obscured by multiple overlying
 abnormalities but can be still seen in the left upper lung.  The left
 subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  The NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.

 HISTORY:  Pulmonary abscesses.  Rule out interval change.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-8**]:

 New opacification in the left lung is a combination of the cavitated abscesses
 due to septic emboli, probable increase in moderate left pleural effusion and
 possibility of new and extensive consolidation in the left lung.  Previous
 fissural distribution of right pleural effusion is less pronounced with erect
 position.  Heart size is normal.

 Nasogastric tube is looped in the airway and passes only as far in the
 esophagus as the upper chest.  Left central line ends in the brachiocephalic
 vein.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-30**] and 8:

 ET tube is 2 cm above the upper margin of the clavicles, at least 4 cm above

 Severe opacification of the left lower lobe and leftward mediastinal shift
 suggests atelectasis, possibly due to airway obstruction.  Greater
 peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung could be new pneumonia or
 atelectasis.  Small pleural effusions may be present but difficult to assess.
 No pneumothorax.  Multiple healed right posterior rib fractures noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT


 CLINICAL INDICATION:  59-year-old male with history of bilateral upper
 extremity AV fistulas requiring PICC for IV antibiotics.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 680**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 559**] performed the procedure, D.
 [**Doctor Last Name 559**], the attending radiologist, was supervising throughout.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
 right brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a
 micropuncture set.  Multiple attempts were made to pass a guidewire through
 the vein without success.  A decision was made to attempt PICC placement on
 the left upper extremity.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guide-wire and a dual-lumen PICC line measuring 41 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the proximal
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  Hand injection of 10 ml of contrast material
 through the PICC demonstrated a tight stenosis at the cavoatrial junction.
 Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
 chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 HISTORY:  80-year-old male involved in a motor vehicle accident status post
 removal of pleural drain, look for pneumothorax.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.

 Comparison is made with prior radiograph dated [**2161-6-17**] done at 5:31 a.m.

 FINDINGS:

 The costophrenic angles bilaterally have not been included, within these
 limitations, the left-sided pleural drain has been removed.  The left basal
 effusion persists.  The tracheostomy tube is approximately 64 mm from the
 carina.  The right central line is projected over the mid to low SVC.
 Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again noted.  The heart is enlarged.
 There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggesting a small right
 basal effusion.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  Left pleural drain has been removed with no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 left basal effusion persists along with atelectasis at the left lung base.
 Blunting of right costophrenic angle suggests a small right basal effusion.
 Right rib fractures are again noted.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 COMPARISON:  Unavailable.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  74-year-old woman with central line placement.  Evaluate
 for position of catheter.

 FINDINGS:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.  Evaluation is
 extremely limited given the portable technique and low lung volumes.  A right
 IJ central venous catheter is seen with its tip in the expected location of
 the superior vena cava.  There is increased retrocardiac density which may be
 related to a hiatal hernia and/or tortuous thoracic aorta.  There is left
 basilar atelectasis versus small pleural effusion.  The heart is likely at
 least moderately enlarged.  The aorta is markedly unfolded.  No definite
 pneumothorax is seen.  Significant degenerative disease is noted at both
 shoulder joints.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate position of right IJ central venous catheter.
 2.  Markedly unfolded thoracic aorta.  Possible hiatal hernia.  Possible small
 left basilar effusion/atelectasis.
 3.  Severe OA at both shoulders.

 additionally progressed since prior chest radiograph, in particular in both
 lung bases as well as in the right upper lobe with complete opacification of
 those areas consistent with progression of the disease.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax but note is made that the lung bases were not included in the

 COMPARISON:  [**2132-4-24**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the left lung base is less
 transparent than on the previous examination, nevertheless, these changes are
 indicative rather of slightly increasing retrocardiac atelectasis than of
 newly occurred parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  No other focal
 parenchymal opacities.  Relatively low lung volumes with moderate cardiomegaly
 and mild signs of overhydration.  At the bases of the right lung, no
 abnormalities are seen.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2132-4-28**] obtained at 05:21
 a.m.

 The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.  The massive
 cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as mediastinal widening.  The lung volumes
 are preserved although relatively low.  New left basal opacity is suspected
 that might represent the area of atelectasis as well as  infection and
 is better seen on the current study due to rotation of the patient.

 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH.

 Comparison made with a prior study from three hours earlier.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  74-year-old woman status post NG tube placement.  Evaluate
 for tube position.

 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable semi-upright chest radiograph is obtained.  The
 NG tube is coiled within the patient's oropharynx.  The right IJ central line
 is unchanged with tip appropriately positioned in the expected region of the
 SVC.  The lungs appear grossly clear bilaterally.  There is likely a small
 left epicardial fat pad causing some silhouetting at the left cardiophrenic
 recess.  A prominent retrocardiac density may represent a hiatal hernia,
 though the tortuous and ectatic thoracic aorta may also contribute.  Heart
 size is likely at the upper limits of normal.  Mediastinal widening is likely
 secondary to a markedly unfolded thoracic aorta.  Severe degenerative changes
 at the left shoulder are noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 Interval unsuccessful attempt at NG tube position with tip coiled in patient's
 oropharynx.  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 16426**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 395**] at
 approximately 9:00 p.m. on date of exam.  The patient has already had removal
 of this tube.

 TWO VIEW CHEST [**2152-6-7**]:

 No prior studies for comparison.

 INDICATION:  Preoperative assessment prior to coronary artery bypass surgery.

 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular structures
 due to crowding.  The right hilum appears more prominent than the left and
 appears asymmetrically dense compared to the left.  Heart is normal in size.
 Aorta is tortuous.  Questionable reticular opacities at lung bases, probably
 due to crowding of structures.

 IMPRESSION:

 Limited study due to low lung volumes.  Prominence of right hilum and apparent
 reticular pattern at lung bases could potentially be due to crowding of
 structures related to low volumes.  However, right hilar lymphadenopathy and
 basilar interstitial abnormality are not excluded.

 Per discussion with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 238**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15868**], the patient is scheduled for a chest CT,
 which will more fully evaluate these regions.

 STUDY:  Fluoroscopic and ultrasound-guided PICC line placement.

 INDICATION:  IV access needed for vancomycin intravenous.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed with two
 patient identifiers.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**], the attending
 radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of the ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately
 after establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed
 over a guidewire and a single-lumen PICC line measuring 36 cm in length was
 then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC
 under fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were
 then removed.  The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
 dressing applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no
 immediate post-procedural complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single-lumen
 PICC line placement via the right basilic venous approach.  Final internal
 length is 36 cm with the tip positioned in the SVC.  The line is ready to use.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  83-year-old male with hypoxia and sepsis after aspiration event at
 nursing home.  Chest x-ray now with rounded left retrocardiac opacity
 concerning for abscess.

 COMPARISON:  Most recent chest radiographs performed earlier on the same day
 at 4:10 a.m. and 5:55 a.m.  CTPA was performed on [**2188-4-21**].  CT abdomen/pelvis
 was performed more recently on [**2188-5-8**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest after
 administration of 75 mL of IV Optiray.  Multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  A right internal jugular venous catheter
 terminates in the distal SVC.  Note is made of narrowing of the right
 subclavian vein with opacification of multiple collateral veins in the upper
 right chest wall.  Aortic, aortic valvular, and coronary artery calcifications
 are as previously seen.  The pulmonary arteries are not well assessed due to
 timing of contrast bolus, therefore evaluation for pulmonary embolism is not
 possible.  Compared to CT of the chest of [**2188-4-21**], there is interval
 resolution of small pericardial effusion as well as bilateral mild- to-
 moderate pleural effusions. Since the CT of the same date, the patient had
 undergone tracheostomy, the site of which is now capped. Debris is noted
 within the upper trachea, otherwise the remaining airways appear patent.

 Again note is made of moderate upper lobe predominant emphysema.  In addition
 to dependent atelectatic changes, bilateral dependent parenchymal
 consolidations are mildly improved compared to CT chest of [**2188-4-21**].  No
 abscess is seen.  Compared to images through the lung bases on more recent CT
 abdomen/pelvis of [**2188-5-8**], consolidation in the right lung base is increased
 but is not changed in the left lung base.  These findings are consistent with
 increased opacity seen in the right lung base on recent chest radiograph,
 likely due to aspiration. Bronchiectasis in the lung bases also are likely due
 to chronic aspiration or post-inflammatory changes.

 (Cont)
 Supraclavicular nodes are subcentimeter in size, as are prevascular nodes.
 However, note is made of a prominent precarinal node which measures 12 mm in
 short axis as well as subcarinal nodes which measure up to 15 mm in short
 axis.

 Limited views through the upper abdomen show a percutaneous gastrostomy in
 place.  Bilateral renal cysts are partially visualized.  Degenerative changes
 are again noted in the thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSIONS:
 1.  Bilateral dependent parenchymal consolidations are improved compared to CT
 chest of [**2188-4-21**].  Since more recent CT abdomen/pelvis of [**2188-5-8**],
 consolidation in the right lung base is slightly increased.  Together with
 findings on recent chest radiograph, this is likely due to aspiration.  These
 changes may be followed radiographically.  No abscess is seen.
 2.  Interval resolution of bilateral pleural effusions since [**2188-4-21**] as well
 as small pericardial effusion.
 3.  Several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are slightly larger than that
 seen on [**2188-4-21**] and could represent reactive change.  Attention to these is
 recommended on followup studies.
 4.  Upper lobe predominant emphysema.
 5.  Aortic valvular calcifications.
 6.  Narrowed right subclavian vein with opacification of multiple chest wall
 collaterals.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2188-6-19**].

 The right PICC line tip location is unclear since its intrathoracic course is
 more superior than expected to be for the subclavian vein and it might be
 within the tributaries of the right subclavian vein that has to be readjusted.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12**] with Dr. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 548**] performed the procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a guide wire was
 advanced through the indwelling left flank PICC line, and subsequently into
 the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The old PICC line was then removed, and
 a peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.  A new double lumen
 PICC line measuring 40 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away
 sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
 Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
 chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a
 new 5 French double lumen PICC line.  Final internal length is 40 cm, with the
 tip positioned in the SVC.  The line is ready to use.

 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:

 COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2117-11-15**], chest radiograph [**2117-10-27**].

 FINDINGS:  The study is slightly limited by motion blurring.  There is an
 opacity in the right lower lobe, similar to the [**10-27**] examination.  The
 left lung appears clear.  The cardiac silhouette, hilar, and mediastinal
 contours appear normal.  No pneumothorax is present.  There is a small right

 terminating within the right atrium, slightly more cranial in position than on
 the prior study.  A left-sided PIC catheter has been removed.  There is
 irregularity to the right 6th posterior rib, which may represent old fracture.
 There is slight cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right venous

 The pre-existing pneumomediastinum appears to be completely resolved.
 However, the pre-existing opacities at the left lung base persist and have
 minimally increased in extent.  Also, the pre-existing left pleural effusion
 has minimally increased in extent.  On this basis, development of an early
 pneumonia should be excluded by short-term radiographic followup using AP and

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  84-year-old woman, status post motor vehicle collision with
 multilevel rib fractures.

 COMPARISON:  Limited comparison from concurrent chest radiograph on [**2173-5-4**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
 symphysis after administration of IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The lungs are symmetrically expanded without
 pneumothorax.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted with mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no parenchymal abnormality to suggest pulmonary
 contusion.  An incidental 2-mm pulmonary nodule is noted in right middle lobe
 (2:25).

 The heart size is top normal, without pericardial effusion.  There are
 scattered calcified plaques along the aortic arch. Coronary artery
 calcifications are also present.  The aorta is otherwise normal in caliber and
 course without acute vascular injury.  The remaining great mediastinal vessels
 are normal.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  A
 moderate hiatal hernia is noted.  The visualized thyroid is normal.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Pneumobilia is moderate in the left hepatic lobe,
                                                             (Over)

 the result of prior sphincterotomy.  The gallbladder is surgically absent.
 There is no solid organ injury.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
 left kidneys are normal.  A 7-mm hypodensity in the lateral cortex of the
 right kidney is too small to be fully evaluated.  The renal parenchyma
 otherwise enhances symmetrically and excretes IV contrast promptly into the
 collecting system.  There is no active extravasation or extraluminal contrast.
 The stomach, duodenum, and loops of small bowel are normal.  There is no free
 air, fluid, or lymphadenopathy in the intra-abdominal cavity.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder is normally distended without focal
 lesions.  The colon demonstrates scattered diverticulosis, but no acute
 diverticulitis.  There is no free fluid, air or lymphadenopathy in the pelvis.
 Significant calcified atherosclerotic plaques are noted along the descending
 aorta.

 BONE WINDOWS:  A minimally displaced manubrial fracture is noted, without
 surrounding hematoma.  Multilevel minimally displaced left rib fractures are
 noted from the third to tenth ribs.  Compression fractures at T7, 8, 11, and
 L1, 3, 4, and 5 demonstrate no retropulsion into the canal.  There is
 significant underlying scoliosis and degenerative changes.  No suspicious
 lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.  Right proximal humeral head deformity
 likely represents sequela of old right shoulder trauma.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute vascular injury.  No acute solid organ injury.  No free air.  No
 pneumoperitoneum.
 2.  Multilevel minimally displaced left rib fractures.  Multilevel compression
 fractures, most severe at T11 and L1.  Minimally displaced manubrial fracture.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with mild bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Moderate hiatal hernia.
 4.  Moderate pneumobilia, predominantly in the left hepatic lobe, secondary to
 prior sphincterotomy.
 5.  7-mm right renal hypodensity, incompletely assessed. An ultrasound can be
 obtained for further evaluation.
 6.  2-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule. If the patient has a prior
 history of malignancy or smoking, then 1 year CT follow up is recommended;
 otherwise no further follow up imaging is needed.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Decreased oxygen saturation.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.

 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal semi-upright portable chest radiograph was
 performed at 16:20, with comparison to the examination from 14 hours previous.

 FINDINGS:  The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 2 cm above the
 carina, with difference from the prior examination, likely secondary to
 differences in head positioning.  Left-sided subclavian central venous
 catheter remains present, with the tip in the lower portion of the
 brachiocephalic, at its junction with the SVC.  NG tube remains in place,
 extending into the stomach.  A single chamber right-sided cardiac pacemaker
 remains present.

 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity
 remains, likely a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusions.  Loculated
 effusions at the right hemithorax appear to have slightly improved with
 improved aeration at the right base.  Prominent left-convex scoliosis of the
 lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine are again noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in aeration at the right lung base.
 Persistent retrocardiac consolidation and/or atelectasis.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained on [**1-6**], [**2195**] at 7:39 a.m.

 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.  The right internal
 jugular line tip is at the low SVC.  Two left chest tubes are in unchanged
 position as well as the right chest tube.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable, but there is interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis and pleural
 effusion that potentially may be related to termination of mechanical
 ventilation.  Post-sternotomy sutures are unremarkable.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.

 AP CHEST, 6:08 A.M. ON [**2-9**]

 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-8**]:

 Right PIC line clearly passes into the right atrium, at least 5.5 cm beyond
 the superior cavoatrial junction, though the tip is not distinct and the line
 may go farther.  Previous small right pleural effusion has decreased, but
 there is persistent consolidation in the infrahilar left lower lobe, which
 could be pneumonia or atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1782**] was paged.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2120-2-2**].

 The cardiomegaly has progressed.  There is bilateral hilar enlargement and
 bilateral perihilar interstitial opacities continuing toward the lung bases
 including the presence of the Kerley B lines, new since the prior study.
 There is also potentially present small bilateral pleural effusions.  The
 findings are mostly suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema.  Underlying
 infection cannot be entirely excluded in evaluation of the patient after
 diuresis is strongly recommended.

 MULTIPLE VIEWS OF THE CHEST, [**2120-2-10**]:57 A.M.

 Over the course of an hour, three views of the chest were obtained, one full
 frontal, the second collimated to the midline, the third collimated and
 partially oblique.  The non-oblique collimated radiograph shows that the right
 PIC catheter, without a guidewire, ends deep in the right atrium approximately
 4.5 cm below the superior cavoatrial junction.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is
 improved.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Lungs clear.  Pleural effusion
 small, on the left, if any.  Findings were reported by telephone to medical

 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no change in
 bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis, although small increase
 in the pleural effusions, currently small to moderate, cannot be excluded.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is present.  Post-sternotomy wires appear stable.

 HISTORY:  A 65-year-old woman status post cerebral aneurysm coiling with flank
 pain and persistent hypercapnia.  Evaluate for RP bleed or pulmonary embolism.

 CT TORSO:  Without IV contrast helical imaging was performed from the thoracic
 inlet through the upper abdomen.  Subsequently, after uneventful
 administration of 100 mL of Optiray, helical imaging was performed from the
 thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis, according to the chest pain
 protocol.  Coronal, sagittal, and right and left MIP oblique reformatted
 images were prepared.

 CT CHEST:  There is no pulmonary embolism, or acute aortic pathology.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There are
 moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
 atelectasis.  There are no definite consolidations in the lungs.  There is
 mild apical septal thickening suggestive of volume overload.  No pneumothorax
 is present.

 CT ABDOMEN:  The spleen, adrenals, pancreas, and liver appear normal without
 focal masses or lesions.  There is vicarious excretion of contrast within the
 gallbladder which otherwise appears unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically, without hydronephrosis.  There is a hypodensity in the
 interpolar region of the right kidney (3:115), too small to characterize.  The
 stomach and abdominal loops of small bowel appear normal.  There is no free
 air within the abdomen.  There are scattered, non-pathologically enlarged
 mesenteric nodes.  The abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic
 calcification, but no aneurysmal dilation.  There is no evidence for
 hemorrhage within the abdomen.

 CT PELVIS:  There is a small amount of simple fluid within the pelvis, but no
 findings suggestive of hemorrhage.  The bladder, uterus appear normal.  The
 adnexa are not well visualized.  The pelvic loops of small and large bowel
 appear unremarkable.  There is no free air in the pelvis.  There is a normal
 visualized appendix.  There is no pelvic, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 INDICATION:  Post CABG bleeding.

 COMPARISON: 12 hours prior.

 AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Eight intact sternotomy wires are stable.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates 5.2 cm above the carina.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends
 in the right interlobar pulmonary artery.  A nasogastric tube coursing through
 the esophagus with its tip outside the plane of imaging is unchanged.
 Bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains are similar to [**2196-1-4**].  Moderate
 left pleural effusion has increased over 12 hours, contiguous with the upper
 aspect of the mediastinum and projecting over the lung, making it impossible
 to exclude either widening of the upper mediastinum or parenchymal abnormality
 in the lung in addition to persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. Right lower
 lobe atelectasis is similar to [**2196-1-4**].

 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left pleural effusion, could be hemothorax; bleeding
 originating in the mediastinum or, less likely, the left lung, needs to be
 considered. Exam is otherwise unchanged since [**2196-1-4**]. Subsequent radiograph,
 followed mediastinal exploration show that the clinical service was aware of
 these findings at the time of this dictation.

 left have increased in size.  The density of the right effusion measures 32 [**Doctor Last Name 137**]
 and is concerning for a hemothorax.  Fluid in the left pleural space measures
 simple fluid.  There is adjacent compressive atelectasis bilaterally.  There
 is fluid and atelectasis within the left major fissure.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  The heart is mildly enlarged with coronary artery vascular
 calcifications.  No pericardial effusion is present.  There is no significant
 axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The tip of the endotracheal
 tube is approximately 1.5 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric tube courses
 through the esophagus entering into the stomach.

 CT ABDOMEN:  The spleen, adrenals, pancreas all appear normal.  There is
 hypodense material within the gallbladder, likely reflecting vicarious
 excretion of contrast as IV contrast was administered on examination from one
 day prior.  Within the posterior right lobe of the liver is a 1.1-cm
 radiodense object which may represent clips or embolization coils but etiology

 is unclear.  Otherwise the liver parenchyma appears normal.  There is a
 horseshoe kidney configuration (2:80).  Within right aspect of the horseshoe
 kidney (2:79) is a hypodense lesion, suggestive of a simple cyst or AML, but
 too small to fully characterize.  There is no hydronephrosis.  There is
 continued excretion of contrast from the horseshoe kidney from examination
 with oral contrast one day prior.  The abdominal aorta demonstrates
 atherosclerotic calcification, but no aneurysm.  Stomach is decompressed with
 a nasogastric catheter.  Small bowel loops appear normal.  There is no free
 air, or free fluid within the abdomen.

 CT PELVIS:  There are scattered sigmoid diverticula, but no diverticulitis.
 No free air or free fluid is present in the pelvis.  Pelvic loops of small
 bowel are normal.  The bladder is decompressed with a Foley.  There is a
 single surgical clip in the low pelvis (2:112).  There is no pelvic, or
 inguinal lymphadenopathy.  There are bilateral fat-containing inguinal
 hernias.

 BONE AND  SOFT TISSUE WINDOWS:  There is overall stable appearance to
 minimally displaced thoracic spine fractures involving T7, T6-T5, and T4.
 There is stable appearance to right T4 and T5 transverse process fractures.
 There is unchanged appearance to a right T6 proximal rib fracture at the
 transverse process articulation.  A minimally displaced superior right
 scapular fracture is also present but was not imaged on the prior examination.
 Patient is status post surgical removal of spinous processes spanning L4
 through L2.  There is stable wedge compression fracture at T12.  There is no
 bony retropulsion into the spinal canal.	

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight interval increase in hematoma abutting the right posterior pleura.
 2.  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.  The density of the
 right effusion is suggestive of a hematoma or hemothorax.
 3.  Stable appearance to thoracic and posterior right rib and transverse
 spinous process fractures.  Right superior scapular fracture is now evident,
 but was not imaged on the prior examination.  Otherwise no new fractures.
 4.  ET tube 1.5 cm from carina.
 5.  Horseshoe kidney configuration.
 6.  Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

 HISTORY:  Right hemothorax.  Chest tube placed.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3-17**] and [**3-18**], 6:29 a.m.:

 Following insertion of right apical pleural drain, the volume of right pleural
 effusion has decreased, with persistence of the right apical extrapleural
 hematoma projecting over the first through fifth posterior ribs.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Widening of the mediastinum would raise concern for mediastinal
 bleeding except that recent CT scanning shows none.  The left lower lobe
 atelectasis has worsened since earlier in the day, and mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Left lung shows mild vascular congestion, but none is present on the
 right.  ET tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the
 diaphragm and out of view.  To assess the extent of trauma to the bony thorax,
 one should consult the report of the CT scan.

 detail.  There is apparent widening of the mediastinum, that is accentuated by
 patient's supine positioning and low lung volumes.  Heart is top normal in
 size.  Low lung volumes accentuate normal pulmonary vasculature.

 IMPRESSION:  Apparent widening of the mediastinum could be accentuated by
 low-lung volumes and supine positioning.  Recommend correlation with known
 recent CT examination of the chest with intravenous contrast to exclude
 possible vascular injury.

 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position and analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of [**2114-2-11**].  Comparison of the frontal
 views again identifies a right-sided basal density indicating pleural effusion
 and probably underlying atelectasis which; however, is concealed.  On the
 lateral view, there is mild blunting of the right-sided posterior pleural
 sinus.  No significant interval change can be identified.  As before, the
 patient has a tracheostomy cannula in place, seen in unchanged position.  The
 next previously available chest CT of [**2113-9-29**], is reviewed.  The
 scan confirmed bilateral basal, mostly posteriorly located atelectasis, but no
 other abnormalities, such as chronic infiltrate or pulmonary mass.

 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no new pulmonary abnormalities since the
 next preceding study.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent PA and lateral chest
 radiographs, [**2196-1-16**].

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.

 FINDINGS:  The left heart border is difficult to visualize in the setting of
 left-sided pleural effusion.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits and unchanged.  Left pleural effusion persists with mild
 improvement and better aeration of the left lung base.  Left basilar
 atelectasis has improved.  Post-infectious small granulomas at the right lung
 apex are unchanged.

 The feeding tube has been removed in the interim.  Displacement of several
 sternotomy wires is consistent with sternal dehiscence.  Patient is status
 post CABG with surgical clips noted.

 There is kyphotic deformity of the thoracic spine with a wedge compression
 fracture of one of the lower thoracic vertebral bodies, likely chronic and
 unchanged since at least [**2195-12-11**].


 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild improvement in left-sided pleural effusion with improved aeration of
 the left lung base.
 2.  Displacement of several sternotomy wires is highly concerning for sternal
 dehiscence, and a followup CT is recommended.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.

 INDICATION:  Dilated cardiomyopathy with hypoxia, status post diuresis, on
 therapy for presumed pneumonia.  Evaluate for infiltrate or edema.

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Moderate degree of cardiomegaly exists, but no typical
 configurational abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta is moderately
 widened and slightly elongated, calcium deposits exist in the wall, mostly at
 the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the
 previously identified bilateral and mostly centrally located diffuse densities
 have regressed further and aeration of the lungs has clearly improved.
 Evidence of bilateral pleural effusion which was clearly present on the chest
 CT examination of [**2179-10-22**] has also progressed and only a mild
 blunting of the posterior pleural sinuses remains.

 IMPRESSION:  Further regression of previously identified pulmonary edema
 pattern.  Although the distribution is rather classical for pulmonary edema,
 the possibility of superimposed inflammatory processes cannot be excluded.
 Further followup to document complete normalization is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MEDICAL HISTORY:  59-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and MRSA
 bacteremia.  A left tunneled femoral dialysis catheter was removed about a
 week ago and a temporary right femoral HD catheter was removed two days ago.
 Patient has a history of central occlusion of the veins in the neck and upper
 chest.  A femoral tunneled hemodialysis catheter placement was requested.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple similar procedures in the past.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1090**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Name (NI) 1009**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 197**] [**Name (STitle) 169**].  Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 169**] is the attending radiologist who was present and supervising
 throughout.

 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
 200 mcg of fentanyl and 2.5 mg of Versed throughout the total intra-service
 time of 1 hour 30 minutes, during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters
 were continuously monitored.  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and lidocaine
 with epinephrine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  An informed written consent was obtained after
 explaining the procedure, benefits, alternatives and risks involved.  Patient
 was brought to angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The
 left groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A
 preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 351**] protocol.

 Under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance with hard copy images of ultrasound
 on file, the left common femoral vein was accessed with a micropuncture set.
 Through the micropuncture sheath, a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire was placed and advanced
 into right atrium.  Appropriate measurements were then obtained for the
 catheter length.  Then after instilling 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, a small
 incision was made over the anterolateral upper thigh.  From this incision, a
 50-cm tip-to-cuff tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed and brought out at
 the venotomy site using the tunneling device.  Then after removing the
 micropuncture sheath, the soft tissue tract was dilated with serial dilators
 over the guidewire.  A peel-away sheath was placed over the guidewire.  The
 inner dilator and guidewire were removed and the catheter was placed through
 the peel-away sheath and advanced into right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was
 then removed.  Catheter secured to skin with 0 silk sutures and venotomy site

  more confluent and nodular area of opacification in the right upper [**Last Name (LF) 3842**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory distress.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed.

 The heart size is stable.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is
 interval development of widespread interstitial/alveolar opacity projecting
 over the entire right hemithorax with a solid content in the mid right lung.
 There are also bilateral Kerley B lines more pronounced on both sides
 laterally.  Overall, the findings may be consistent with a combination of
 pulmonary edema and superimposed consolidation due to infection, aspiration or
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis(given the known history of cholangiocarcinoma that
 potentially could spread to the lungs).  Follow up after diuresis is
 recommended.

 The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates biliary stent due to
 known cholangiocarcinoma.

 PROCEDURE:  CT chest without contrast.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Trauma with right hemothorax.  Assess for interval change.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT chest performed without IV contrast.  5-mm and 1.25-mm axial
 slices were acquired with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 Comparison was made to the previous study on [**2156-6-11**].

 FINDINGS:
 A moderately large right hemothorax persists athough there has been interval
 improvement in the degree of aeration in the lower lobes bilaterally with a
 slight decrease in the left pleural effusion.  The remaining lungs are
 unchanged and a chest drain, which enters the anterior chest wall has been
 slightly withdrawn since the previous study with no appreciable pneumothorax.

 and approximately 9 cm above the carina with overinflation of the cuff and
 requires repositioning.  The NG tube passes into the stomach.  The aorta,
 pulmonary artery and heart size is normal.  No pericardial effusion.

 This examination was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, which is
 unremarkable.

 Posterior rib fractures are unchanged in position, a number of which are
 displaced and overriding in the upper posterior hemithorax in addition to a
 nondisplaced scapular fracture.

 Impression:
 1) Proximal position ET tube and apparent overdistention of cuff.  Recommend
 readjusting the ET tube to a lower in position and decreasing the volume of
 air within the cuff.

 2)Stable moderately large organizing right hemothorax with improved aeration
 in both lower lungs bilaterally and decreasing left pleural effusion.

 3)Multiple rib fractures are predominantly right-sided, a number of which are
 displaced and overriding in the upper chest wall in addition to a stable
 nondisplaced left scapular fracture.

 INDICATION:  84-year-old woman with febrile neutropenia.  Evaluate for source
 of abscess.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following the
 administration of intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reconstructions were
 generated.  Comparison is made to prior CT performed [**2173-5-11**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT THORAX:
 Large bilateral pleural effusions are again identified.  There is extensive
 atelectasis in the basilar segments of both lower lobes as on prior scan.
 There has been interval development of confluent areas of consolidation and
 ground-glass opacities in both lungs, most prominent in the left upper lobe.
 The findings are consistent with pneumonia.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric
 tube are in satisfactory position.  A right subclavian pacemaker is in situ.
 There is a fracture of the sternal manubrium, in keeping with history of
 trauma.  Tracheostomy in satisfactory position.

 CT ABDOMEN:
 A small amount of free fluid is seen in the abdomen, which is decreased in
 comparison to the prior CT.  No focal parenchymal abnormality is identified in
 the liver or adrenal glands.  A small focal area of calcification is
 identified within the spleen, which is otherwise unremarkable in appearance. A
 small cortical cyst is seen at the upper pole of the right kidney.  There is
 no hydronephrosis of the kidneys.  The small and large bowel are not opacified
 with oral contrast but appear grossly unremarkable.  There is anasarca of the
 abdominal wall.

 A small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis.  The uterus appears
 unremarkable.  A urinary catheter is in situ and air within the urinary
 bladder is presumably related to catheterization.

 There is scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine and multiple compression
 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae as on prior scan.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in both
 lungs, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  Large bilateral pleural
 effusions are unchanged in size.
 2.  No focal fluid collection is seen in the abdomen or pelvis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PROCEDURE:  CT torso without contrast.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Worsening respiratory failure and hypoxemia.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT torso was performed without IV contrast.  Axial images were
 acquired from the apices to the lower pelvis with multiplanar reformats.

 Comparison was made to the previous CT [**2173-6-1**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:

 Multifocal relatively geographic areas of consolidation in the upper lobes and
 diffusely throughout the lower lobes bilaterally in addition to diffuse
 ground-glass opacities have progressed since the previous study in [**2173-5-6**]
 and are consistent with worsening pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 moderately large on the right and small on the left side have slightly
 increased and bibasilar atelectasis is worse.  The patient remains intubated
 with the ET tube in satisfactory position.  The caliber of the aorta,
 pulmonary artery and heart size is normal with a trace pericardial effusion
 most likely physiological.  Calcification is severe throughout the coronary
 arteries, atrial and ventricular pacing leads are in standard position.The
 central airways are widely patent.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  There is dense contrast in the cecum and throughout
 the right colon with contrast passing distally into the rectum.  Apparent
 thickening of the distal colon may be due to mild thickening of the wall,
 however, the colon is collapsed and difficult to accurately appreciate in the
 absence of IV contrast.  However, there is an adequately distended segment in
 the descending colon which does show non-stratified mural thickening.  No free
 air or pneumatosis.

 Diffuse pneumobilia is unchanged consistent with a previous sphincterotomy. A
 PEG tube is in the stomach. Punctate calcifications in the spleen suggest
 granulomata.  Diffuse mural calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta are
 consistent with severe atheromatous disease.  There is probably high grade
 narrowing at the aortic bifurcation and perhaps even occlusion.  Vascular
 disease is extensive.

 A duodenal diverticulum is unchanged.  The distal esphagus remains mildly
 dilated with fluid. Most of the small bowel is again slightly dilated and
 fluid-filled suggesting a degree of ileus.

 Soft tissues are diffusely anasarcous.  The bladder is decompressed with a
 Foley catheter in place.  The uterus and adnexa are normal.

 Numerous compression fractures throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine are
 unchanged. A fracture of the manubrium sterni is stable

 IMPRESSION:

 1)Progression of multifocal ground-glass and consolidation throughout the
 lungs in addition to a slight increase in bilateral pleural effusions, which
 are moderately large on the right, small on the left and increasing bibasilar
 atelectasis.

 2)Stable pneumobilia.

 3)Ileus with dense retained contrast in the ascending colon, contrast passes
 distally to the rectum.

 4)Mild thickening of the distal colon which could be associated with a
 widespread edematous state although mild colitis is a possibility.
 Correlation with clinical factors is recommended.

 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip terminating 2.8 cm
 above the carina.  Nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  A new area
 of lucency has developed at the right lung base adjacent to the medial right
 hemidiaphragm and is concerning for a possible basilar pneumothorax.
 Multifocal asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities have slightly
 improved and could reflect asymmetrical edema, but coexisting aspiration
 pneumonia is also possible given the asymmetry.

 The air collection adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm has been discussed with
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24195**] with recommendation for short-term followup radiograph.

 HISTORY:  38-year-old man with history of trauma with head injury and multiple
 fractures including bilateral ribs and left scapula.  Now presents with new
 respiratory distress.  Status post intubation.  Assess for pulmonary embolism.

 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT torso study from [**Hospital3 29881**] obtained on
 [**2156-6-5**] AT 18:58 HOURS.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained from the thoracic
 inlet to the lung bases after administration of IV contrast.  However, the IV
 contrast was done by hand in junction secondary to the lack of peripheral IV
 line, resulting in markedly suboptimal IV bolus timing.  Multiplanar
 reformatted images were obtained.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The markedly suboptimal IV bolus timing by hand
 injection renders the study to almost non-diagnostic.  There is no central
 pulmonary embolism.  Evaluation for lobar and subsegmental pulmonary embolism
 is inadequate.  There is slightly increased caliber of the central pulmonary
 vessels which may be related to the state of hydration.

 The aorta is normal in course and caliber without acute aortic pathology.  The
 remaining great mediastinal vessels are unremarkable.  A right-sided central
 venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The heart size is
 within normal limits and without pericardial effusion.  =

 Scattered numerous mediastinal nodes are not pathologically enlarged.  No
 hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is noted.  The patient is intubated, with
 the endotracheal tube terminating approximately 4.1 cm above the carina.
 There is mild mucous secretion in the dependent portion of the lower trachea.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study obtained six hours earlier during the
 same day.  The patient remains on ventilator with tracheostomy cannula in
 unchanged position.  A new right internal jugular approach central venous line
 has been placed during the interval and is seen to terminate overlying the SVC
 at the level 1 cm below the carina.  No pneumothorax has developed. The
 previously described bilateral parenchymal densities persist.  There are more
 marked densities on the bases but the apparent change in appearance is
 probably related to some degree in postural change.  The patient tilting more
 posteriorly now than previously.  Thus there is no significant interval change
 of the cardiovascular, pulmonary status on this portable chest examination.
 The improvement since chest examination [**5-18**] is recognized.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated placement of new right internal jugular approach
 central venous line.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2156-6-5**] AT 2114 HOURS.

 HISTORY:  New right subclavian Cordis placement.

 COMPARISON:  Earlier same night.

 FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, Cordis sheath is placed from a
 right subclavian approach.  There is suggestion of a kink approximately 4.8 cm
 proximal to the distal tip of the catheter which overlies the midline
 mediastinum oriented in a slightly atypical course for the superior vena cava.
 The small right pneumothorax again is not clearly demonstrated on this supine
 radiograph.  Multiple displaced right-sided rib fractures are seen.  The known
 left-sided rib fractures are not radiographically evident.  The mediastinum is
 well defined.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.  The
 nasogastric and endotracheal tubes are stable in course and position.
 Fracture through the left scapula is now identified.

 IMPRESSION:  New Cordis sheath as above.  There is a kink in the catheter and
 the course towards the mediastinum is atypical for superior vena cava
 placement.  Correlate clinically.  Arterial placement cannot be excluded on
 the basis of this examination.

 SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval intubation with the
 ET tube terminating approximately 6 cm above the carina.  The feeding tube is
 in stable position.  A right-sided central line is unchanged.

 Bilateral rib fractures are unchanged, multiple and consecutive on the right,
 concerning for flail chest.  In the short interim of 9 hours, a large right
 pleural effusion has increased dramatically in size, raising question of
 hemothorax.  A small left effusion is stable. General hazy opacity over the
 right lung is due to layering fluid.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
 Remainder of the left lung is clear.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Rapidly enlarging right pleural effusion concerning for hemothorax.
 Clinical correlation with hematocrit count is recommended.  Persistent small
 left small pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis.

 2.  Multi-trauma with consecutive rib fractures more extensive on the right,
 concerning for flail chest.

 INDICATION:  Possible ileus or obstruction after paraesophageal hernia repair
 and feeding tube placement and question of pneumonia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2173-5-20**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the pubic
 symphysis without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted
 images were obtained.

 CONTRAST:  Oral contrast only.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Tracheostomy tube terminates
 with tip in the lower trachea.  Right-sided pacemaker with dual electrodes is
 again noted.  Since the examination of [**2173-5-20**], there has been
 placement of bilateral pleural drainage catheters with decrease in size of
 bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate on the right and nearly resolved on
 the left.  Patchy areas of pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacity and
 consolidation are little changed in the interval, although atelectasis at the
 bases bilaterally has improved.  A small amount of oral contrast is seen
 within the esophagus which could possibly relate to reflux versus recent
 administration.  There is a small left anterior hydropneumothorax with
 left-sided chest tube in place.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels
 appear unchanged allowing for non-contrast technique with coronary artery
 calcifications again noted.  A 1.7 cm subcarinal lymph node is unchanged and
 may be reactive.  A small amount of fluid is seen in the posterior mediastinum
 adjacent to the distal esophagus (2:39), and may be post-surgical in nature.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Since the examination of
 [**5-20**], there is new diffuse pneumobilia.  No focal liver lesions are

 visualized.  Pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  A couple
 of punctate calcifications in the spleen are consistent with granulomas.
 Non-contrast appearance of the kidneys is unremarkable without evidence of
 hydronephrosis.  Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with mural calcification
 consistent with atheromatous disease.  Note is made of dense calcification at
 the origin of the right common iliac artery suggesting a severe stenosis, but
 incompletely evaluated.  There is a gas and contrast-filled duodenal
 diverticulum adjacent to the ampulla.  A gastrostomy tube is new since the
 previous examination, entering via left upper quadrant and terminating in the
 gastric body.  Contrast fills multiple loops of mildly prominent small bowel
 with some fecalization of distal small bowel visualized, but no evidence of
 transition point to suggest small-bowel obstruction.  There is contrast within
 the colon and appendix.  No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.  Diffuse
 anasarca is present in the subcutaneous tissues and midline anterior abdominal
 incision with metallic skin staples noted.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is in place
 within the bladder.  The uterus and adnexa, and pelvic loops of bowel appear
 unremarkable.  Small amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac is of low density.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Numerous compression deformities of the thoracic and lumbar
 spine, as well as spinal degenerative change, appear unchanged.  A fracture of
 the sternal manubrium is in unchanged alignment.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of bowel obstruction, although mildly prominent loops of small
 bowel diffusely could reflect a component of ileus.

 2.  Improved bilateral pleural effusions after interval placement of bilateral
 chest tubes.  Left-sided small hydropneumothorax, new.  Unchanged bilateral
 pulmonary consolidation consistent with pneumonia with improved bibasilar
 atelectasis.

 3.  Interval development of pneumobilia.  Please correlate with possible
 history of sphincterotomy or other intervention.

 4.  Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, a nonspecific finding that could
 relate to postoperative change.

 HISTORY:  Post-VATS washout and decortication for hemothorax.

 COMPARISON:  Earlier same day.

 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in standard and stable position
 approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An enteric feeding tube projects over the
 included upper abdomen with the distal tip likely at the ligament of Treitz in
 again adequate position.  A right subclavian approach central line is noted in
 stable position with the distal tip projecting over the superior vena cava.
 The previously noted right chest tube directed towards the mid superior
 mediastinum has either been removed or repositioned.  Currently, there is a
 basally directed chest tube as well as a second tube directed apically.  There
 is marked volume loss of the right hemithorax.  Extensive markedly displaced
 lateral right-sided rib fractures are more apparent on the current study.
 There is increased opacity in the right hilar and medial right lower lung.
 Respiratory motion blurs the lower left lung but grossly no consolidation is
 seen.  The mediastinum morphology and cardiac silhouette size is grossly
 stable.

 IMPRESSION:  Apparent removal and replacement of right-sided chest tubes as
 detailed above.  No discrete visceral pleural line is noted.  There is
 increased opacity at the medial right lung base, which may be in part due to
 atelectasis, contusion related to chest tubes, or aspiration.  Correlate
 clinically.

 HOURS.

 HISTORY:  Pedestrian versus automobile.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There is an extensively comminuted significantly displaced and
 distracted proximal humerus fracture principally through the surgical neck
 with involvement of the greater tuberosity.  The humeral head itself is
 grossly appropriately aligned within the glenoid fossa as best could be
 determined.  A non-displaced scapular fracture, documented on accompanying
 chest CT, is not well seen.  The distal humerus is intact.  The elbow joint is
 grossly appropriately aligned.  No fracture involving the distal forearm is
 seen.  There is extensive soft tissue irregularity principally over the dorsal
 aspect.  The wrist joint is grossly appropriately aligned.

 IMPRESSION:  Extensively comminuted proximal humerus fracture with significant
 distraction.  No definite dislocation.  Known left scapular fracture not well
 seen.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

 An ET tube is present, tip slightly high at the upper edge of the clavicles,
 approximately 7.1 cm above the carina.  An NG Dobbhoff-type tube is present,
 tip overlying the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  On these views, I
 cannot confirm that this has passed beyond the pylorus.  A right subclavian
 central line is present, tip at distal most SVC.  A right-sided chest tube is
 present.  An IVC filter is also seen.

 There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with retrocardiac air
 bronchograms.  There is probable layering small to moderate left effusion.
 There is a possible fluid level at the right lung base -- however, compared to
 the coronal reformats from the [**2156-6-11**] CT scan, this may actually be an
 artifact due to an unusual pattern of atelectasis. Otherwise, no evidence fo
 pneumothoraxis identified. A right-sided pleural effusion is likely also
 present.  Multiple rib fractures are seen bilaterally. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is not enlarged and remains midline.  No CHF.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Lines and tubes as described.  The tip of the ET tube is relatively high,
 lying at the upper edge of the medial clavicular heads.

 2.  Possible fluid level at right base, but recent CT suggests that this is
 artifact. Otherwise,  no evidence for pneumothorax is detected.

 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.

 4.  Left greater than right effusions.

 5.  Bilateral rib fractures.

 PROCEDURE:  Chest portable AP.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  History of COPD, assess for pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  The tip of the right PICC line is in the mid SVC, unchanged.
 Parenchymal opacities in the right lung base have improved since the previous
 study and may have been due to aspiration or resolving infection.  Mild
 interstitial prominence in the lower lobes bilaterally with hyperlucency in
 the apices is consistent with the known history of COPD.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.

 IMPRESSION:

 Improving right lower lobe opacity is probably resolving aspiration or
 infection.

 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position 6.5 cm above the carina.
 An NG-type tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm -- the radiopaque tip is
 coiled and overlies the upper/mid left abdomen.  A right IJ central line is
 present, tip at SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.

 A right-sided chest tube is present. No pneumothorax is detected. Multiple
 biateral rib fractures are noted, with some right-sided pleural
 thickening/hemorrhage.

 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  There is blunting of both costophrenic angles.
 Doubt overt CHF. Probable atelectasis at right costophrenic angle. The patient
 also has a known left scapular fracture that is not well depicted on this

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma, now status post fall from bed, rule out fracture.

 COMPARISON:  [**2156-6-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the cervical spine were obtained
 without IV contrast.

 FINDINGS:  There is no prevertebral soft tissue abnormality. The cervical
 lordosis is preserved.  A vertically-oriented fracture through the left C2
 transverse process is unchanged in alignment, with interval development of
 expected periosteal reaction.  There is also a comminuted fracture of the left
 scapula as well as a mildly displaced fracture of the right scapula, both of
 which also demonstrate bridging periosteal reaction, compatible with interval
 healing.  No new fracture is identified.  Limited assessment of the spinal
 canal reveals no epidural hematoma.  A small ossific density projecting
 anterior to the C5-6 interspace likely reflects an osteophyte or ligamentous
 ossification.

 Limited views of the lung apices reveal a right apical pneumothorax.

 Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification as well as moderate mucosal
 thickening of the right maxillary sinus are better assessed on concurrent head
 CT.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No change in alignment of the left C2 transverse process fracture, with
 evidence of early interval healing.
 2.  Bilateral scapular fractures, also with evidence of healing.
 3.  No new fracture.
 4.  Large right apical pneumothorax, better assessed on dedicated chest
 radiography.

 PORTABLE CHEST ON [**2156-6-20**] AT 05:57.

 INDICATION:  Two right chest tubes.

 COMPARISON:  [**2156-6-19**].

 FINDINGS:

 There is slight lucency at the right apex, but I do not see clear line to
 demarcate apical pneumothorax as had been demonstrated previously.  However,
 laterally, there is a finding consistent with an element of pneumothorax.  All
 lines and tubes remain in place.  There is no new focal consolidation.  Some
 additional blunting at the right CP angle is likely related to some increased
 right pleural fluid.

 IMPRESSION:  Overall, little change compared to the prior study with no
 evidence of new airspace disease.  Shifting location of right PTX but not
 progressively enlarging.  Followup is recommended.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 547**] [**Name (STitle) 291**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1617**] [**Name (STitle) 291**], the
 attending radiologist supervised throughout.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a single-lumen PICC line measuring 44 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 4 French
 single-lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach.  Final
 internal length is 44 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.  The line is ready

 INDICATION:  Rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, smoking, sepsis.
 Evaluate position of internal jugular central venous catheter.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison to a radiograph dated [**2126-10-22**] performed 10 hours ago.
 The wide bore feeding tube tip is high lying at the level of the
 esophagogastric junction and the fine bore nasogastric tube is in satisfactory
 position with tip projected over the expected location of the pylorus.  The
 left internal jugular central venous catheter is projected over the left
 paratracheal space and may lie within a left-sided SVC or a tributary, its
 position is higher than on the prior radiograph, either due to patient
 positioning or tube manipulation.

 Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema are unchanged since the radiograph
 performed 10 hours ago.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged since
 [**2126-10-19**].  There has been overall interval improvement in the appearance of the
 left upper lobe pneumonia since [**2126-10-19**].

 IMPRESSION:  Aberrant position of the left internal jugular central venous
 catheter, possibly within the left-sided SVC or a tributary.

 The wide bore feeding tube should be advanced by approximately 6 cm to avoid
 gastroesophageal reflux.

 Pulmonary edema, moderate cardiomegaly, and left lower lobe atelectasis are
 stable since a radiograph performed earlier today.

 INDICATION:  73-year-old woman with dyspnea.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2105-5-27**]

 SINGLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Moderate cardiomegaly is changed since
 prior study.  Bilateral perihilar and interstitial opacities, suggestive of
 acute pulmonary edema are new since the prior study.  The opacity in the
 retrocardiac left lung base, likely represents atelectasis; however,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Small left pleural effusion may be
 present.  No significant right pleural effusions are detected.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings suggestive of acute pulmonary edema.
 2.  Retrocardiac left lung base opacity, likely represents a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion, although underlying consolidation/infectious
 not excluded.  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph following diuresis.

 improved interstitial pulmonary edema. Lymphangytic spread is also a
 posibility.  More confluent right upper lobe opacity has also improved, as
 before could be asymmetric edema or superimposed infection and continuous
 followup is recommended.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small
 right pleural effusion.  Catheters project in the right upper quadrant.

 lymphoma  .

 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.

 The central venous line was inserted through jugular approach with the line
 being located approximately 3.5 cm below the cavoatrial junction and should be
 repositioned.  The right paratracheal stripe is enlarged and might represent
 lymphadenopathy.  There is also distortion of the periaortic contour that
 potentially might represent lymphadenopathy as well, especially given the
 diagnosis of lymphoma in this patient.

 Bilateral pleural effusions are present, right more than left.  Minimal
 bibasilar opacity is seen that potentially might represent area of
 atelectasis.  No cross-sectional studies were previously obtained, evaluation
 of the patient with CT of the chest will be recommended for evaluation of the
 degree of lymphadenopathy as well as basal involvement by consolidation.

    524.0 uCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Egg Whites Labelled with Sulfur Colloid ([**2105-6-17**]);
 HISTORY: IDDM with nausea and vomiting

 INTERPRETATION:

 Patient Consumed::: 4 oz. egg beaters 2 oz. water 2 slices of white toast 30 gm
 grape jelly

 Immediately following the oral ingestion of the radio-labeled meal, the patient
 was placed supine in the gamma camera. Continuous anterior and posterior images
 of tracer activity in the stomach and bowel were recorded for 45 minutes.
 Delayed anterior and posterior images were obtained at 2, 3 and 4 hours (as
 needed).

 Residual tracer activity in the stomach is as follows:

 At 45 mins 80% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach
 At 2 hours 67% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach
 At 3 hours 64% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach
 At 4 hours 22% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach

 Patient's gastric emptying curve plateaus for the first 3 hours before
 increasing in a linear fashion for the last hour.  This is an abnormal study
 with delayed gastric empyting.

 IMPRESSION:  1. Patient has a delay in gastric empyting with 22% residual
 activity at 4 hours.

 One portable view.  Comparison with [**2105-5-23**].  Lungs are expanded and diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacities appear improved.  The circumscribed area of
 lucency at the right base is less apparent than on the earlier study.  The
 heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  An endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube remain in place.

 IMPRESSION:  Possible interval improvement in diffuse bilateral airspace
 disease.  Improved appearance may also be due to increased lung volumes.  A
 focal area of lucency at the right base which may have represented a small
 basilar pneumothorax is less apparent on the current study.  No other definite
 change.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  84-year-old with ischemic colitis, hypotension, atrial
 fibrillation, and pleural effusions.  Evaluate for interval change.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the torso [**2173-5-7**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis
 was performed following the administration of 130 cc of IV Optiray contrast as
 well as oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed.

 CT OF THE CHEST:  ET tube terminates in the distal trachea and right
 subclavian catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  There are extensive coronary
 artery calcifications.  Mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm in the
 precarinal nodal station are likely reactive.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 have increased in size and they are now moderate with significant compressive
 atelectasis of the lung bases.  The remainder of the lungs is mostly clear
 with no consolidation or edema.  There is a 5-mm nodule in the right upper
 lobe (2:26) which is unchanged from prior.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  A moderate-sized hiatal hernia is noted.  Pneumobilia is
 again present consistent with history of sphincterotomy in [**2171**].  The spleen,
 pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance and excrete
 contrast symmetrically.  Small hypodensities in both kidneys are too small to
 further characterize but most likely cysts.  The abdominal aorta is heavily
 calcified, however non-aneurysmal.  The celiac axis and SMA are patent.  There
 is dense calcification at the origin of the celiac axis.  The intra-abdominal
 small bowel loops are normal.  Contrast has yet to reach the colon, however
 the colon is less distended than on the prior exam and the previously seen
 slight thickening of the splenic flexure is no longer identified.  There is no
 ascites or lymphadenopathy.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:  Foley catheter and air are seen within the bladder.  There
 is a small amount of pelvic free fluid.  The sigmoid colon and rectum are
 unremarkable.

 The soft tissues demonstrate anasarca which has increased compared to the
 prior exam.  Multiple minimally displaced left 3rd through 10th rib fractures
 and multiple compression deformities in the thoracic spine are again seen.  No
 suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

  1.  Left lower lobe volume loss and consolidation, which may in part reflect

  process is not excluded.
  2.  Endotracheal tube positioned with the tip in the right main stem bronchus
  and should be repositioned.

  3.  Small bilateral effusions.

  4.  Moderate hiatal hernia, within which is coiled the nasogastric tube.

  5.  Resolution of pneumobilia, with mild intrahepatic biliary ductal
  dilatation.

  6.  Diffuse mild distention of a fluid-filled colon with minimal wall
  thickening identified in the region of the splenic flexure.  These findings
  are nonspecific and may reflect ileus, though early inflammatory change (which
  could be due to infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic etiologies) is not
  excluded.  Close clinical and imaging followup as indicated is recommended.

  7.  Multiple bony findings, including fractures of the lateral left ribs, and

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 CT CHEST:  There is volume loss and consolidation involving the left lower
 lobe.  This may reflect malpositioning of the endotracheal tube in the right
 mainstem bronchus, though a component of infection is also possible.
 Elsewhere, the lungs demonstrate diffuse hypoventilatory changes, without
 definite focus of consolidation.  There are small effusions bilaterally. There
 is no pneumothorax.  There are no pulmonary nodules or masses identified.

 The heart is unremarkable with the exception of coronary calcifications. There
 is no pericardial effusion.  The aorta and great vessels demonstrate mild
 atherosclerosis, without acute abnormality.  This study was not optimized for
 evaluation of the pulmonary arterial tree, except to note no dilatation of the
 main pulmonary artery and no large central embolus.

 There is no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 within the esophagus, coiled within a moderate-sized paraesophageal hiatal
 hernia before passing into the upper stomach.

 The patient is intubated.  As mentioned, the endotracheal tube passes into the
 right mainstem bronchus.  There is a right subclavian central line, which
 terminates in the superior vena cava.

 CT ABDOMEN:  The liver demonstrates no focal lesions and is normal in
 attenuation.  The hepatic vasculature, including the portal veins, are widely
 patent.  There is mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation, similar in appearance
 to prior study.  Pneumobilia has resolved.  The gallbladder is surgically
 absent.  The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal.  The renal
 parenchyma demonstrates symmetric enhancement.  There is a small hypodense
 lesion within the mid pole of the right kidney, unchanged from prior study,
 and too small to fully characterize.  There is no hydronephrosis.  There are
 no enhancing renal mass lesions.

 The stomach, duodenum, and small bowel are unremarkable.  There is no small
 bowel distention or wall thickening.  The colon, however, appears slightly
 abnormal.  It is mildly distended and diffusely fluid-filled.  There are
 segments where the wall appears minimally thickened (i.e., splenic flexure).
 However, the mucosa enhances normally, and there is no frank wall edema, and
 no pneumatosis.  There is no free air in the abdomen and no portal venous air.

 There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.  There is no large
 ascites, although small free fluid is identified in the cul-de-sac.

 The aorta is diffusely calcified, including the ostia of the mesenteric
 vessels; however, the major mesenteric arteries are patent.  The superior
 mesenteric vein is similarly patent without clot.

 CT PELVIS:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.  The bladder is
 decompressed by the Foley catheter.  There is a small amount of fluid in the
 cul-de-sac.  There are no adnexal masses identified.  There is no pelvic or
 inguinal adenopathy.  Air is identified in the right groin in the region of
 the femoral vessels.  This likely relates to recent line placement attempt.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There is no acute change compared to prior study [**2173-5-4**].  Multiple minimally displaced left rib fractures spanning from the third
 through tenth ribs are again noted.  The spine is also diffusely abnormal,
 with severe degenerative change, and multiple compression fractures involving
 T7, T8, T11, L1, L3, L4, and L5.  As before, there are no suspicious lytic or
 sclerotic osseous lesions identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Left lower lobe volume loss and consolidation, which may in part reflect
 hypoventilation secondary to right mainstem intubation, though additional
 infectious process is not excluded.

 2.  Endotracheal tube positioned with the tip in the right main stem bronchus

 HISTORY:  38-year-old male pedestrian in a race, struck by vehicle,
 transferred for reported intracranial hemorrhage, pneumothorax and multiple
 rib fractures, and pelvic fractures.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Images from CT chest, abdomen and pelvis obtained at [**Hospital1 20654**] on [**2156-6-5**] at 7:02 p.m. are uploaded on to PACS for second opinion
 interpretation which is requested by trauma surgeon.  Apparent MDCT axial
 imaging was performed through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after
 administration of 100 mL of IV Isovue 370.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted
 images were then obtained.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart, great vessels, and pericardium are
 intact.  The patient is intubated, with small amount of debris seen within the
 upper trachea.  There are multiple bilateral rib fractures, delineated below,
 with adjacent probable contusion seen along the lateral right upper lobe.
 There are also bilateral small right greater than left hemothorax as well as
 [**Year (4 digits) 24463**] right pneumothorax seen anteriorly at the apex and the base as well as at
 the site of presumed pulmonary contusion.  Dependent atelectatic changes are
 also noted.  There is no adenopathy noted.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen and splenule,
 pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, stomach, small bowel, colon, and
 appendix appear normal.  There is no free air or free fluid within the
                                                             (Over)

 abdomen.  The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber and without evidence of
 injury.  Small mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for
 adenopathy.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is near empty.  Punctate
 calcifications are noted within the prostate.  The rectosigmoid colon and
 pelvic loops of bowel appear unremarkable.  No pelvic free fluid or
 lymphadenopathy is noted.  The iliac arteries are intact.  Phleboliths are
 noted within the pelvis.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL STRUCTURES:  There are multiple bilateral rib fractures on the
 right.  These are seen laterally involving ribs, two through nine.  On the
 left, fractures are seen involving ribs, three to seven anteriorly and ribs
 five and six posteriorly.  These are nondisplaced to mildly displaced
 fractures.

 There is nondisplaced vertically oriented fracture through the left scapula as
 well as incompletely visualized fracture through the proximal left humerus.
 Gas is seen within the soft tissue planes anterior to this fracture.

 There is anterior compression fracture of T12, with approximately 33% loss of
 anterior vertebral body height, without retropulsion.

 There is a minimally displaced fracture along the right sacral ala as well as
 minimally displaced fractures through bilateral superior pubic rami as well as
 inferior right pubic ramus.

 No large hematoma is seen surrounding any of these fractures.  Small hematoma
 is seen along the lateral right rib fractures.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures, with small right greater than left
 hemothorax, [**Clip Number (Radiology) 24463**] right pneumothorax, and small area of possible lung contusion
 along the lateral right upper lobe.
 2.  Essentially nondisplaced fracture of the left scapula and with what
 appears to be comminuted fracture of the left proximal humerus, incompletely
 visualized.
 3.  Anterior compression fracture of T12, without retropulsion.
 4.  Minimally displaced fractures through the right sacral ala, superior and
 inferior right pubic rami, and superior left pubic ramus, without large pelvic
 hematoma seen.
 5.  No intra-abdominal injury seen.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-26**] through 6:

 Relatively uniform opacification in both lower lungs has been present since
 [**11-26**].  How much of it is due to pleural effusion and how much due to the
 pulmonary abnormality is difficult to distinguish.  It is consistent with but
 certainly not diagnostic of pneumonia, though the left lower lobe is more
 airless on the right.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 mildly engorged.  A connector obscures some of the right lung apex.  ET tube
 and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric
 tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Thoracic aorta is heavily
 calcified and tortuous but not dilated.

 No prior examinations for comparison.

 CHEST, AP:  Note is made of apical lordotic positioning.  The lungs are clear.
 Mild retrocardiac atelectasis is present, without focal consolidation.  The
 heart size is at the upper limits of normal, with a tortuous and unfolded
 aorta.  There are no significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The bones
 are diffusely demineralized, with mild S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis and
 multilevel bridging osteophytes.  There is an age-indeterminate compression
 deformity of a lower thoracic vertebra, likely T12, with near-complete loss of
 height.  Multiple rib fractures are in various stages of healing.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Age-indeterminate T12 compression fracture, with near-complete loss of
 height.  This was paged to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1247**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6446**] on [**2121-11-30**] at 7:50 a.m.

 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to [**12-1**]:

 Severe bibasilar consolidation should be considered pneumonia until proved
 otherwise.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is developing, but pleural
 effusions are small and have not increased.  Heart is normal size.  ET tube
 tip is at the upper margin of the clavicles more than 4.5 cm from the carina.
 The patient's kyphosis means that this distance is probably substantially
 greater and the tube can be safely advanced 2 cm.  A right internal jugular
 line ends in the mid SVC and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and
 out of view.  Deformities of ribs on both sides of the chest indicate previous
 fractures.  Whether there are acute fractures is difficult to say without
 targeted radiographs.

 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY [**2114-12-5**]

 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.

 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Persistent opacities
 within the lower lungs likely representing a combination of pleural effusion
 and adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation.  As compared to the recent
 study, the right lower lobe has slightly worsened with increased obscuration

 helpful to more fully evaluate this region when the patient's condition
 permits, particularly to exclude a developing pneumonia at this site.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Please place tunneled HD line.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 MEDICAL HISTORY:  60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, on
 hemodialysis.  A groin HD line was pulled out a few days ago for MRSA
 bacteremia and for line holiday.  Today, the patient presents for placement of
 a new tunneled HD catheter.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1090**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 713**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 714**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 714**], the attending
 radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.

 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
 50 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time
 of 20 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored.  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and 1% lidocaine
 with epinephrine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  An informed written consent was obtained after
 explaining the procedure, benefits, alternatives and risks involved.  The
 patient was brought to angiography suite and an ultrasound examination of the
 neck was performed prior to the procedure; it demonstrated bilateral
 occlusions of the internal jugular veins.  However, the external jugular veins
 were patent on both sides and there was evidence of multiple collateral veins
 in the neck.  A decision was made to attempt placement of an external jugular
 venous catheter on the right side.  The right side of the neck and upper chest
 were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preprocedure huddle and
 timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 351**] protocol.

 Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, access was obtained
 into a patent right external jugular vein with a micropuncture set.  However,
 the guidewire could not be advanced past the right brachiocephalic vein. Then,
 a venogram was performed by contrast injection through the micropuncture
 sheath, which demonstrated complete occlusion of the right brachiocephalic
 vein with extensive collateral formation.  Attempts to cross the obstruction
 with guidewire were unsuccessful.  Therefore, the procedure was abandoned and
 a decision was made to attempt placement of the line on the left side.  The
 micropuncture sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved with digital
 compression.  A sterile dressing was applied.

 (Cont)
 Next, the left side of the neck and upper chest were prepped and draped in the
 usual sterile fashion.  Access was obtained into a patent left external
 jugular vein with a micropuncture set under ultrasound guidance.  From this
 access, the guidewire could be easily advanced into the right atrium.  After
 taking appropriate measurements, the 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire was advanced into IVC
 under fluoroscopic control using a Kumpe catheter.  Then, attention was
 directed to tunneling the HD catheter.  A small skin incision was made over
 the left upper chest.  A 27 cm tip-to-cuff hemodialysis catheter was tunneled
 through from the left upper chest and brought out at the venotomy site.
 Because of the acute angulation at left brachiocephalic and SVC junction, the
 guidewire was exchanged for a super stiff Amplatz wire through the Kumpe
 catheter.  The soft tissue tract was then dilated over the wire.  A peel-away
 sheath was placed and the inner dilator as well as the guidewire were removed.
 The catheter was placed through the peel-away sheath and tip advanced into the
 right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was then removed.  Both ports of the
 catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film
 was obtained and stored digitally.  The catheter was secured to the skin with
 0 silk sutures and venotomy site closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture.  Sterile
 dressings were applied.  Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were
 no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ultrasound examination demonstrated complete occlusion of both internal
 jugular veins with patent external jugular veins bilaterally and extensive
 collateral formation in the neck.
 2.  Attempt to place a HD catheter via right external jugular venous access
 was unsuccessful as there was complete occlusion of the right brachiocephalic
 vein which was confirmed by a venogram.
 3.  Successful ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided placement of a 27 cm
 tip-to-cuff tunneled hemodialysis catheter via left external jugular venous
 access with the tip of the catheter terminating in the right atrium.  The line
 is ready for use.

 HISTORY:  66-year-old female with hypoxia, tachycardia and recent femur
 fracture.  Question PE.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the chest was performed
 according to the departmental CTPA protocol.  Axial images were acquired with
 and without intravenous contrast.  Additionally, coronal, sagittal, and
 oblique images of the pulmonary arteries were created.

 FINDINGS:  The pulmonary arteries opacify normally without intraluminal
 thrombus.  The aorta opacifies normally and is of normal caliber.
 Atherosclerotic calcification is noted predominantly in the descending aorta.

 Respiratory motion somewhat limits evaluation of the lung parenchyma. There
 are bibasilar airspace consolidations, left greater than right, with
 near-complete collapse of the left lower lobe basal segments and partial
 atelectasis in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.  Secretions are
 noted within both basal segment lower lobe bronchi.  The lung parenchyma
 enhances homogeneously.  Within the right lower lobe, there is peribronchial
 infiltration.  A trace left pleural effusion is identified. The right pleural
 space is unremarkable.

 The heart is top normal in size.  A small pericardial effusion is present.
 Soft tissue attenuation within the pretracheal, subcarinal, and adjacent
 paraesophageal regions likely represents ill-defined lymphadenopathy, possibly
 reactive.  The hilar lymph nodes are of normal caliber.

 The ribs demonstrate a mottled appearance bilaterally with areas of bony

 Additionally, there is a healed insufficiency fracture of the sternum.
 Compression fractures of the T7 and T12 vertebral bodies are of indeterminate
 chronicity.  There is no associated hematoma.

 Incidentally noted are multiple low-density lesions within an enlarged
 thyroid.  Although this study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
 evaluation, a low-density lesion measuring 2 cm is noted within the interpolar
 region of the left kidney which is probably a cyst.  No additional
 abnormalities are identified in the imaged upper abdomen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for new left internal jugular catheter placement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph chest.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph most recently [**2163-12-8**].  Also, chest CT
 in [**2163-11-28**].

 FINDINGS:  New left internal jugular central venous catheter is seen coursing
 inferiorly in the left chest at the level of the carina.  It does not turn
 medially as if it were in the left brachiocephalic and superior vena cava.
 Comparison with recent non-contrast CT is limited but does not show persistent
 left SVC.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in appearance.
 Dense bilateral consolidations are unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart is normal in size.  Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.

 IMPRESSION: 1)  New left internal jugular catheter within the left chest tube
 ending at the level of the carina.  If venous blood is obtained, likely with
 an aberrant SVC which was not demonstrated on the CT or another smaller
 mediastinal vein.  If arterial blood is obtained, likely within left common
 carotid or descending aorta.  Recommend determination of this and then
 subsequent repositioning, if necessary.

 2)  No interval change in multifocal pneumonia.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2159-11-27**].

 Comparison made with prior study from [**2159-11-26**].

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with bilateral subdural hematomas,
 question of hilar mass seen on prior radiograph, question interval change.

 FINDINGS:  AP, lateral upright portable views of the chest were obtained.  An
 NG tube courses inferiorly below the left hemidiaphragm.  The thoracic
 kyphosis somewhat limits evaluation through the lung bases, though note is
 made of bilateral layering pleural effusions, which have increased on the
 right and appear stable to marginally increased on the left.  Bilateral lower
 lobe compressive atelectasis is likely also present though cannot exclude the
 possibility of pneumonia.  Followup to resolution is advised.  Mid upper lungs
 appear well aerated.  There is no pneumothorax or definite signs of pulmonary
 edema.  The prominence of the pulmonary hila, as previously mentioned, likely
 reflect prominent vasculature, though the lateral view does not aid in
 evaluation given the suboptimal penetration.  Heart size cannot be readily is
 assessed.  Mediastinal contour is stable with prominence of the right tracheal
 stripe likely reflective of the hepatic vasculature.  The bony structures
 appear diffusely demineralized.  Aorta is densely calcified.

 Multiple calcified densities in the right upper quadrant are compatible with
 gallstones.  Additionally, calcified densities to the right of the mid lumbar
 spine are again noted, of uncertain etiology, question kidney stone.

 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and probable bibasilar compressive
 atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Prominence of hilar
 vasculature could reflect mild congestion.

 EXAMINATION: CT OF THE TORSO SECOND OPINION

 INDICATION: Evaluate for pneumonia or traumatic injury.

 COMPARISONS: NONE AVAILABLE

 TECHNIQUE: Outside hospital imaging of the chest/abdomen and pelvis are
 provided for rereview.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is dense parenchymal lung
 consolidation involving the left upper lobe, the right middle lobe, and both
 left and right lower lobes.  In addition, there are areas of dense parenchymal
 consolidation involving the right middle lobe.  Multiple air bronchograms are
 seen within these areas of dense parenchymal consolidation.  Overall, the
 findings are compatible with multifocal pneumonia.  There are no discrete
 pulmonary nodules.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The
 tracheobronchial tree is patent to the subsegmental level.  There are multiple
 scattered axillary lymph nodes, and a pathologically enlarged 11-mm in
 transverse dimension pretracheal mediastinal lymph node with multiple other
 smaller scattered mediastinal lymph nodes, a 15-mm in transverse dimension
 subcarinal lymph node.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is unremarkable.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is slightly increased
 attenuation of the gallbladder, likely related to layering sludge.  The liver,
 spleen, pancreas, both adrenal glands, both kidneys, both ureters, and
 visualized portions of intra-abdominal small and large bowel are unremarkable.
 There is no intra-abdominal free air or free fluid.  There is multiple in
 number retroperitoneal lymph nodes, that do not meet size criteria for
 pathologic enlargement.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon,
 bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic
 free fluid.  Multiple scattered pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes do not meet
 size criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There is no pelvic free fluid.

 into proximal arch vessels.  The pulmonary artery is well opacified,
 demonstrating occlusive and partially occlusive lobar, segmental and
 subsegmental bilateral pulmonary emboli extending into the left upper lobe,
 lingula, and left lower lobe pulmonary arteries on the left, and into the
 right lower lobe, and to a lesser extent into the right upper lobe pulmonary
 arteries.  There is some enlargement of the right ventricle and straightening
 of the interventricular septum, that may suggest right cardiac strain (RV/LV
 ratio on axial images 1.7). However other signs of strain are not present: the
 main pulmonary artrey is not dilated (3.1 cm) compared to the ascending aorta
 (3.9 cm) and there is no reflaux in the IVC.

 The heart is top normal in size without pericardial effusion.  Patient is
 status post intubation, with ET tube terminating at 2.5 cm above the carina. A
 feeding tube traverses through a widely patulous esophagus into the stomach.

 Within the lungs, a small peripheral wedge-shaped opacity, best demonstrated
 on coronal view (400B, 23), is suggestive of a pulmonary infarct.  There is
 also bilateral basilar atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion. Right
 apical linear scarring with associated calcifications appears unchanged,
 likely related to prior granulomatous disease.

 Limited subdiaphragmatic evaluation demonstrates no significant visceral
 abnormality.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  34-year-old male with sepsis, unresponsive to antibiotic
 therapy.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed
 administering IV and oral contrast [**Doctor Last Name 1309**].  Multiplanar reformatted images were
 also obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan dated [**2163-12-8**].

 FINDINGS:

 CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE CHEST:

 Again noted is extensive pneumonic consolidation involving both the lungs.
 However, as compared to the prior study, there is improvement seen more so in
 the inferior lobes bilaterally with improved volume of aerated lung.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  The endotracheal tube is optimal in
 position.  There is no mucus plug noted in the major airways.  Central venous
 line is noted in the right internal jugular vein all the way up to the
 cavoatrial junction.  Again noted are axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes
 which appear unchanged.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The cardiac
 [**Doctor Last Name 1443**] are within normal limits.

 Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen:  Unchanged appearance of prominent
 mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes is noted.  The bowel loops and
 stomach are normal in caliber.  There is no ascites seen.  There is no
 evidence of free air in the abdomen noted.  There is no evidence of
 collections noted in the abdominal cavity.  The liver is enlarged in size and
 measures 22 cm in midclavicular line. The spleen, pancreas, gallbladder,
 adrenals are unremarkable.

 The kidneys demonstrate normal attenuation bilaterally with no evidence of
 calculi or hydronephrosis.There is a hypodense area seen in the papillary
 region of the right kidney (Series 2, image 90).This may represent either
 papillary necrosis or a non filling calyceal diverticulum and has remained
 unchanged since the last exam.

 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from 20 minutes ago and more remote radiographs from
 [**2183-9-13**] and chest CT from [**2183-9-9**].

 CHEST, SINGLE VIEW:  The patient is in supine position.  There has been
 interval intubation with the ET tube tip 2.5 cm above the carina.  A feeding
 tube traverses inferiorly into the stomach.  The side port is below the GE
 junction.  Prominent cardiac silhouette is unchanged, likely accentuated by AP
 technique and supine position.  Right apical linear scarring is again
 demonstrated.  Trace linear atelectasis is seen in the left base.  The lungs
 otherwise demonstrate no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process, although
 correlation with lateral view would be helpful.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation with the ET tube tip 2.5 cm above the carina.

 INDICATION:  44-year-old status post CABG, evaluate for widened mediastinum
 and left effusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph obtained.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs obtained with
 dates ranging from [**2173-9-9**] to [**2173-9-19**].

 FINDINGS:  Stable left basilar chest tube.  No pneumothorax.  Stable right
 internal jugular venous catheter with tip in the upper SVC.  Improved
 postoperative widened mediastinum, likely reflecting improved central venous
 caliber.  Increased retrocardiac and lingular opacification likely due to
 combination of slightly increased small left pleural effusion and atelectasis;
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
 Unexplained right mid lung triangular opacification with sharp lateral edge
 may represent external object versus atelectasis.
 Stable, moderate-to-large enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Hilar contours
 obscured by wide mediastinum but visualized portions are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Less apparent widened mediastinum due to decreased central venous
 pressure.  Increased opacification of left lung base may reflect atelectasis
 and stable small left pleural effusion; however, an infectious process cannot
 be excluded.  No major reaccumulation of fluid.

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    10.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2173-9-13**]);
    33.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2173-9-13**]);
 HISTORY:  43 y.o. male with chest pain and EKG changes.  Regional LV systolic
 dysfunction noted on TTE.  No prior history of CAD.

 SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 Exercise protocol:  [**Doctor First Name 3258**]
 Resting heart rate:  59
 Resting blood pressure:  126/78
 Exercise Duration:  3.5 minutes
 Peak heart rate:  127
 Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 72%
 Peak blood pressure:  172/74
 Symptoms during exercise: Atypical anginal symptoms
 Reason exercise terminated:  Fatigue
 ECG findings:  Non-specific ST segment changes

 METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.  Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 At peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi
 was administered IV.  Stress images were obtained approximately 15 minutes
 following tracer injection.

 Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 Left ventricular cavity size is mildly enlarged.

 Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a large, moderate severity, partially
 reversible perfusion defect of the inferior and inferolateral wall, apex, and
 distal anterior wall.  There is also dilatation of the left ventricular cavity
 size at stress relative to rest.

 Gated images reveal hypokinesis of the inferior wall.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 50% with an EDV of 106 mL
 at rest.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 41% with an EDV of 123 mL

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right-sided hemothorax, pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:

 Three total frontal views of the right chest are submitted in the operating
 room, status post chest tube placement.  The first radiograph demonstrates a
 large right-sided pneumothorax with atelectasis at the right lung and
 bronchoscope is in place.  Left lung is relatively clear.

 The second radiograph demonstrates a right-sided chest tube placed with
 relative expansion of the right lung and approximately a 10% right-sided
 pneumothorax with peripheral density along the right lung.  The third
 radiograph demonstrates the chest tube placed medially with the tip positioned
 at the right lung apex.  There is a large soft tissue density at the right
 lung periphery and apex which could represent blood or developing hematoma.
 There is atelectasis at the right lung base.  An ET tube has been placed and

  PFI:  Interval development of right upper lobe opacification, with volume
  loss, compatible with collapse.  There is obliteration of the right upper lobe
  bronchi, likely secondary to direct tumor invasion.  There is additional
  irregularity and narrowing of the right main stem, lower, middle lobe bronchi,
  also secondary to malignant involvement.  There is opacification with air
  bronchograms in the right lower lobe, which may represent post-obstructive
  atelectasis, hemorrhage, or infection.  A chest tube is in adequate position,
  with a small residual anterior pneumothorax.  No appreciable effusion.  Left
  lung remains clear.

 interval change.

 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT of the chest dated [**2119-8-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the chest was performed following the
 administration of 75 cc of intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reformats were
 prepared and reviewed.

 FINDINGS:

 Comparison to prior study, there has been complete opacification and volume
 loss in the right upper lobe, with nonvisualization/obliteration of the right
 upper lobe bronchus, which on outside study was seen to be markedly narrowed
 by encasing tumor.  There is additional irregularity and narrowing due to soft
 tissue encasing the right main stem bronchus, as well as the bronchus
 intermedius.  There is increased consolidation with air bronchograms in the
 right lower lobe posteriorly at the base, which may reflect aspiration,
 hemorrhage, or infection.  Multiple small simple nodules, better characterized
 on outside study, are not seen secondary to interval development of pulmonary
 consolidation.  The known hilar mass is also not well characterized, secondary
 to adjacent collapse and opacification.

 There is a chest tube identified coursing along the right posteriorly to base,
 in adequate position.  There is no appreciable effusion.  There is a small
 pneumothorax seen anteriorly.

 The left lung is clear, with minimal dependent atelectasis.  There is no

 pulmonary nodule or mass identified on the left.

 The heart is normal without pericardial effusion.  Aorta and great vessels are
 normal.  Main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber, there is no large central
 pulmonary embolus.  The right upper lobe pulmonary arteries are attenuated,
 possibly reflecting compression by adjacent mass.  There is also narrowing of
 the right superior pulmonary vein.

 There is pretracheal adenopathy identified, with lymph nodes measuring up to
 12 mm in short axis.  Additional subcarinal soft tissue is noted, though it is
 difficult to distinguish adenopathy from direct tumor invasion.  There is no
 prevascular adenopathy identified.  There is no adenopathy identified in the
 lower cervical chains or supraclavicular region.  There is no axillary
 adenopathy.

 The patient is intubated, with the endotracheal tube in adequate position.  A
 nasogastric tube passes into the stomach, though the sideholes are in the
 region of the gastroesophageal junction, and this should be advanced for
 optimal positioning.

 There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified.
 Degenerative changes are seen in the spine, with associated endplate sclerosis
 and disc space narrowing.  There is mild wedging of the low thoracic vertebral
 bodies, without evidence for acute compression deformity or metastatic
 disease.

 There is no acute abnormality identified in the visualized portion of the
 upper abdomen.  The adrenal glands appear normal.  There is no retrocrural or
 superior retroperitoneal adenopathy.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  In comparison to [**2119-8-30**], there has been interval development
 of complete opacification of the right upper lobe.

 2.  Large right hilar mass encasing right main and upper lobe bronchi in
 addition to bronchus intermedius. There is pretrachial adenopathy and a
 subcarinal mass which may represent contiguous tumor or adenopathy. The
 assessment of the local extent of the mass is somewhat limited by extent of
 adjacent pulmonary opacity and volume loss.

 3.  Right chest tube in adequate position.  A small residual anterior
 pneumothorax is noted.

 PFI:  Interval development of right upper lobe opacification, with volume
 loss, compatible with collapse.  There is obliteration of the right upper lobe
 bronchi, likely secondary to direct tumor invasion.  There is additional
 irregularity and narrowing of the right main stem, lower, middle lobe bronchi,
 also secondary to malignant involvement.  There is opacification with air
 bronchograms in the right lower lobe, which may represent post-obstructive
 atelectasis, hemorrhage, or infection.  A chest tube is in adequate position,
 with a small residual anterior pneumothorax.  No appreciable effusion.  Left
 lung remains clear.

 AP CHEST 5:15 A.M.  ON [**12-3**]:

 HISTORY:  Volume overload.  Question change.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-27**] through [**12-2**]:

 There has been very little change in the chest since [**11-27**].  Opacification
 at the bases of both hemithoraces are due at least in part to moderate left
 pleural effusion, but how much pleural effusion and how much lower lobe
 consolidation has been difficult to discriminate on frontal bedside
 radiographs alone.  I would strongly urge conventional views including lateral
 projection to see whether there is consolidation independent of pleural fluid.
 The heart is normal size, upper lungs are clear.  There has been very little
 to suggest volume overload on any of the recent prior chest radiographs,
 specifically the mediastinum has a normal caliber on all but one of these
 chest radiographs.

 Left PIC catheter can be traced as far as the upper SVC, but the tip is
 obscured.  No pneumothorax.

 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic, interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened.
 Greater opacification at the right base could be a combination of edema and
 increasing moderate effusion, though pneumonia might give a similar
 appearance.  The same is true for left lower lobe opacification, though
 atelectasis is more common on that side.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right PIC
 line is traceable only as far as the right third rib in the axilla.  No

 INDICATION:  Post-subarachnoid hemorrhage with clipping of anterior
 communicating artery aneurysm. Post ventricular fibrillation arrest today with
 hypoxia, query pulmonary embolus.

 COMPARISON:  [**Last Name (LF) 5807**], [**2166-1-24**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images from the lung apices to the lung
 bases displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with IV contrast only.  Coronal and
 sagittal 3D reformats have been provided.

 FINDINGS:
 The patient is intubated with the tip of the ET tube just above the carina.
 No mediastinal, hilar, internal mammary or axillary adenopathy.
 No pulmonary embolus identified.
 There are bibasilar pleural effusions, moderate in size with bibasilar
 atelectasis noted of both lower lobes.  The effusions have increased in size
 since prior imaging.
 Again there is bilateral apical infiltrates identified within the upper lobes
 with associated ground-glass change.  Findings have also progressed when
 compared to prior imaging.  It is seen to affect the upper lobes greater than
 the lower lobes and is bilateral.  Differential diagnosis includes atypical
 infection such as atypical pneumonia or viral causes, aspiration pneumonia or
 neurogenic pulmonary edema.
 No evidence for pneumothorax.

 Although, the study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  No
 abnormalities are noted in the visualized upper abdomen.
 No osseous destructive lesion.


 CONCLUSION:
 1. No pulmonary embolus.
 2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, increased in size since prior imaging.
 3. Diffuse ground glass inflammatory change at both lung apices concerning for
 infection, aspiration or  pulmonary edema.

 AP CHEST 5:25 A.M. [**12-1**]

 HISTORY:  81-year-old woman with respiratory failure, evaluate possible
 pneumonia or volume overload.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-26**] through [**11-30**]:

 All of these chest radiographs show greater opacification in the lower chest
 bilaterally, right greater than left, but it is still unclear how much of the
 abnormality is due to pleural effusion and how much due to pulmonary
 abnormality and whether that is pneumonia or atelectasis.  It would be very
 useful at this stage to perform at least upright conventional radiographs, or
 a chest CT scan, whichever is clinically feasible.  Heart is moderately
 enlarged but unchanged.  The upper lungs are clear and pulmonary vascular
 congestion is not particularly severe.  ET tube and right internal jugular
 line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes below the
 diaphragm and out of view.  There is no pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are present.  An ET tube
 terminates 3 cm above the carina appropriately.  An NG tube terminates in the
 stomach appropriately.  A right IJ catheter rears towards the midline and may
 be intra-arterial though this may be secondary to patient rotation to the
 left.

 IMPRESSION:

 One portable view.  Comparison with [**2122-12-5**].  Bilateral pulmonary opacities
 consistent with parenchymal consolidation, most pronounced in the left
 infrahilar region and subsegmental atelectasis at the right base are again
 demonstrated.  There is increased perihilar density on the right.  The patient
 is rotated to the left and positioning is antilordotic as before.  Mediastinal
 structures are unchanged.  An endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and internal
 jugular catheter remain in place.  The nasogastric tube has been advanced
 somewhat and now terminates off of the bottom of the image.  Its side hole is
 not visible.  There is re-demonstration of compression deformity of a lower
 thoracic vertebral body.

 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pulmonary opacities suspicious for pneumonia.  There
 appears to be slight interval worsening on the right.  The nasogastric tube
 has been advanced.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  36-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage and concern for PE.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the chest was performed
 with intravenous contrast.  Sagittal, coronal, and oblique images of the
 pulmonary arteries were created.

 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is no mediastinal or hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  There is a small amount of pericardial fluid.  Following
 contrast administration the aorta opacifies normally without evidence of
 dissection.  The pulmonary arteries opacify normally without evidence of
 pulmonary embolus.  An endotracheal tube terminates 4.9 cm above the carina.

 There are large dense bibasilar consolidations which are concerning for
 aspiration or infection.  There is interlobular septal thickening and diffuse
 ground-glass opacities, most likely representing interstitial and alveolar
 edema.  No pulmonary nodules or masses are visualized within the aerated lung.
 Small pleural effusions are noted bilateral.

 There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the osseous
 structures.

 Although this study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, no
 abnormalities are noted within the visualized upper abdomen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

 2.  Dense bibasilar consolidations which are concerning for aspiration or
 infection.

 3.  Moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, [**2163-12-8**] at 12:32 hours.

 FINDINGS:  New right internal jugular catheter is seen terminating in the low
 SVC.  Left IJ catheter that is likely in an aberrant left-sided vein is
 unchanged in position in the left chest.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric
 tube are in satisfactory position.  There is no change to the dense bilateral
 consolidations.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Stable
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right IJ catheter in appropriate position without evidence of
 complications including pneumothorax.  Stable aberrant left IJ location as
 well as endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
 2.  Unchanged appearance of dense bilateral pneumonia.

 HISTORY:  Nasogastric tube in patient with dysphagia.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**11-24**], there is a nasogastric tube that
 extends to the lower body of the stomach.  There is again paramediastinal
 prominence on the right, most likely representing tortuous brachiocephalic
 vessels.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  Mild haziness at the left base again
 could reflect a layering pleural effusion.  Calcifications in the right upper
 quadrant again could reflect gallstones.

 There is apparent nodular opacification in the right infrahilar region that
 was not appreciated on the previous oblique image.  A repeat study with a
 lateral view would be helpful if clinically warranted to determine whether
 this represents a real finding such as adenopathy.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 INDICATIONS:  Worsening aspiration.

 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.

 CHEST, PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT:  The film is blurry and underpenetrated.  A
 central venous catheter and a nasogastric tube appear unchanged.  A newly
 apparent layering right pleural effusion is suggested by this study, although
 a confounding factor is a soft tissue attenuation and underpenetration.  A
 right infrahilar opacity which had suggested aspiration is poorly delineated
 on this study.  The central pulmonary vasculature is prominent, suggesting
 mild pulmonary edema.  The azygos vein appears distended with widening of the
 pulmonary vascular pedicle suggesting fluid overload or cardiac failure.
 Persistent opacity is present in the left lower lung and potentially increased
 in extent, noting nonvisualization of the left hemidiaphragm on this study,
 whereas it could be mostly delineated previously.  Another limitation is that
 the left costophrenic sulcus is excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with a possible
 layering pleural effusion on the right.  It is difficult to assess for a
 pleural effusion on the left, but noting similar to increased left lower lobe
 opacity.

 Although aspiration would be a differential consideration, such an appearance
 could be seen with extensive atelectasis or consolidation due to pneumonia.

 Repeat followup radiographs may be helpful given the technical limitations of
 this study.

 HISTORY:  Central catheter placement.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a left IJ catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
 Endotracheal tube is in place with its tip approximately 4.2 cm above the
 carina.  Increased opacification in the retrocardiac area with obscuration of
 the hemidiaphragm is consistent with atelectasis and probable effusion.  No
 definite pulmonary vascular congestion.

  chest:  no evidence of PE or acute aortic syndrome.  there is increase in
  bilateral dependent consoldiations, which in conjunction with dilated, fluid-
  filled esophagus is highly suspicious for aspiration.  opacification/plugging
  of the LLL bronchi is noted, supporting this diagnosis.  there are small
  bilateral effusions.  no ptx.  aorta is unremarkable.

  abd/pelvis: stomach is fluid filled and moderately distended.  the small bowel
  is also dilated and fluid filled, but air also seen thruogh the colon, and
  there is no transition point or collpases loops distally.  this is most c/w
  ileus, though early or partial obstruction cannot be excluded and close f/up
  is advised.  retained contrast is seen in the colon.  a surgical drain courses
  under the liver.  there is post-operative stranding in the RUQ but no large
  fluid collection.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute hypoxic event, exclude pulmonary embolus.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet
 through to the pubic symphysis during intravenous contrast administration.
 Initial non-contrast images of the chest were also obtained.  Sagittal and
 coronal reformatted images were also performed and interpreted.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS:  There is bibasilar consolidation
 versus collapse and a small right-sided pleural effusion.  No pulmonary
 parenchymal masses, no pulmonary emboli.  There is no significant hilar,
 mediastinal or axillary adenopathy.  There is marked atherosclerotic disease
 of the aorta and its branches including the coronary arteries.  Of note is a
 markedly distended esophagus with an air-fluid level, this continues to the GE
 junction.

 The heart and remaining vasculature appear unremarkable.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS:  No indication in history is given
 for performance of the abdomen or pelvic study.  The patient is apparently
 status post cholecystectomy though this is not formally stated in the
 requisition.  The liver is homogeneous without masses, the portal vein and
 hepatic veins are patent, no biliary ductal dilatation.  Surgical drain
 identified as well as anterior abdominal postoperative changes.  There is
 diffuse dilatation of the stomach, small and large bowel.  There is no
                                                             (Over)

 significant adenopathy or ascites.  There is splenosis, the kidneys, adrenal
 glands, and pancreas are grossly unremarkable.  Atherosclerotic disease of the
 aorta and its branches appear patent.  There is likely a moderate stenosis
 involving the right renal artery.  Scattered metallic foreign densities are
 unchanged.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS:  Dilated loops of large and small
 bowel with contrast seen within the rectum.  Unclear as to whether this
 contrast represents that recently given or from the prior CT scan.  There is a
 minimal amount of free fluid in the pelvis, note of a fat-containing
 uncomplicated right inguinal hernia, mild anasarca.

 Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic change, just
 degenerative changes.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus, bibasilar consolidation versus collapse,
 correlation is necessary to discern between the two.
 2.  Extensive coronary artery and aortic calcification.
 3.  Diffusely dilated esophagus, stomach, and large and small bowel, most
 consistent with a postoperative ileus.  There is an abrupt transition in bowel
 caliber involving the distal sigmoid colon, which was present on the prior
 study, no mass lesion is seen; however, given its unchanged appearance on two
 CT scans, a stricture should be considered.
 4.  Postoperative changes and surgical drain in this patient is apparently
 status post cholecystectomy.
 5.  Remaining findings such as splenosis, degenerative changes, radiopaque
 foreign densities are all unchanged.

 INDICATION:  CAD, shortness of breath, nasogastric tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  [**2161-5-13**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable.  The tip of the
 tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach, with the sidehole
 located exactly at the gastroesophageal junction.  For secure gastric
 placement the tube could be advanced by approximately 10 cm.

 No evidence of complications.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT

 INDICATION:  IV access needed for antibiotics.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 171**] [**Name (STitle) 88292**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 58**] [**Name (STitle) 59**] performed the procedure.Th
 attending,Dr [**First Name (STitle) 59**], was present during the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access are on file.  A peel-away sheath was then
 placed over a guide wire, and a double lumen PICC line measuring 42 cm
 intravascular and 2 cm outside was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 with its tip positioned in the distal SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
 Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
 chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 5 French
 double lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach. Final
 internal length is 42 cm intravascular, with the tip positioned in SVC. The
 line is ready to use.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  MRI cervical and thoracic spine.

 HISTORY:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar, multisequence MRI was performed without gadolinium as
 per departmental protocol.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:

 CERVICAL SPINE:  Alignment is anatomic.  Vertebral body height is maintained.
 There is diffuse multilevel disc desiccation and degenerative change as
 described below.

 At C3-C4, a broad-based disc bulge combines with severe ligamentous buckling
 to moderately narrow the spinal canal, with remodeling of the ventral spinal
 cord.  The cervical spinal cord at this level has equivocal increased signal.
 There are no other regions of significant spinal canal narrowing within the
 cervical spine.

 Endotracheal and esophageal tubes are partially visualized.

 THORACIC SPINE:  Vertebral body height is maintained.  There is heterogeneous
 marrow signal.  A T1/T2/STIR bright lesion in the T7 vertebral body is likely
 a hemangioma.  There are no suspicious osseous lesions.

 There is a well-defined, rounded region of increased T2 signal within the
 central thoracic spinal cord, extending from T5 through T9.  There is diffuse
 disc desiccation, with small disc herniations throughout much of the mid
 thoracic spine, but no signifiacnt thoracic spinal canal narrowing.

 A small lacunar infarct is partially visualized in the pons.  Partially
 visualized structures of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are significant for
 ascites and bilateral pleural effusions. The thoracic aorta has a heterogenous
 flow void, which may represent low flow or artifact.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No high-grade cervical or thoracic spinal canal narrowing.
 2.  High signal within the central mid-thoracic spinal cord may represent a
                                                             (Over)

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral, radiographs obtained.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to portable chest film performed [**2173-9-20**].

 FINDINGS:  Right middle lobe opacification with sharp lateral edge is again
 seen and stable since [**2173-9-9**], possibly atelectasis versus fibrosis.  Slight
 reduction in retrocardiac opacification likely due to decrease in left pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Stable postoperative mediastinal widening.  Stable
 moderate-to-large cardiac silhouette.  Hilar contours are normal.

 IMPRESSION:  Decreased retrocardiac opacity likely due to decreased effusion
 and atelectasis.  Stable right mid lung opacification of unclear etiology may
 represent scarring.  Consider chest CT to better evaluate when patient
 clinically appropriate.

 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph with no prior studies available for
 comparison.

 The current study demonstrates right mediastinal shift in combination with
 abrupt termination of the right main bronchus as well as irregularity in
 tracheal column.  In addition, there is a small right pneumothorax.  Findings
 are consistent with known history of extensive right lung cancer with right
 main stem obstruction and subsequent complete collapse of the right lung.

 The left lung is essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Comparison with outside studies as well as cross-sectional
 imaging is highly recommended.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2126-10-7**].

 FINDINGS:  Consistent with the prior exams, there are predominantly reticular
 peripheral interstitial opacities consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis.
 Please note the parenchymal evaluation is markedly limited at the lung bases
 due to respiratory motion.  However, in the interval, there is a newly
 developed infiltrate in the left upper lobe, highly suspicious for pneumonia.
 The mediastinum is grossly stable.  The cardiac silhouette likewise is similar
 in size.  No gross effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  Respiratory motion
 again limits evaluation.  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.

 STUDY:  AP chest [**2126-10-20**].

 HISTORY:  Placement with central venous line.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study performed three hours earlier.

 The endotracheal tube tip is now 4.6 cm above the carina, appropriately sited.
 There is a new left IJ central venous catheter whose distal tip is likely at
 the brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  This could be advanced 4 to 5 cm for more
 optimal placement.  There is again seen diffuse airspace opacities throughout
 both lung fields which are unchanged.  Nasogastric tube is also seen and new
 and the distal tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction.  No
 pneumothoraces are present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary fibrosis with intubation, to assess for change.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**10-21**], the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  The left IJ catheter has shifted position and takes a vertical
 course to the left of the trachea, most likely within a left-sided superior
 vena cava.  The tip of the Dobbhoff tube lies above the esophagogastric
 junction, though the nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and passes
 below the inferior margin of the image.  There is continued diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications, most likely representing the known diffuse pulmonary
 fibrosis with possibly some component of superimposed pulmonary edema.
 Another possibility would be resolving upper lobe pneumonia.

 Retrocardiac opacification with blunting of the costophrenic angle appears to
 be slightly increased, consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  The
 possibility of superimposed pneumonia in this area must be considered.

 INDICATION:  89-year-old woman with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the
 gallbladder.  Request is to evaluate for distant disease and local invasion.

 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to a noncontrast CT of the abdomen dated [**8-13**], [**2184**] and also liver ultrasound dated [**8-13**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters following administration of oral
 and intravenous contrast.  Arterial, portal venous and delayed phase imaging
 was performed.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were also evaluated.

 CT THORAX:
 There has been interval development of bilateral moderately-sized pleural
 effusions.  There is associated bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  There is
 linear scarring and traction bronchiectasis involving the medial aspects of
 the right upper lobe.  High-density material is seen within the collapsed
 pulmonary parenchyma in keeping with calcium.
 Findings are minimally changed since a prior CT of [**2178**] and may related to
 previous tuberculosis exposure.
 No discrete pulmonary nodules.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:  Again, there is marked enlargement of mural thickening of the
 gallbladder which measures 6 x 7.4 x 7.4 cm.  The lower portion of the
 gallbladder mass closely approximates the transverse colon; however, a fat
                                                             (Over)

 plane is distinguishable. The mass is more closley related to a portion of the
 ascending colon (700b:16)with no demonstrable fat plane between the two
 srtuctures. The mass also runs adjacent to the second part of duodenum, but
 again there is an apparent fat plane between two structures. More superiorly
 however the upper portion of the mass is confluent with the first part of
 duodenum
 (3b:154) Of note, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery courses between
 the gallbladder mass and the second part of duodenum (3b:166).  The mass is
 adjacent to but appears separate from the pancreatic head.  There is stranding
 of the mesenteric fat around the gallbladder.  A small focus of air is likely
 secondary to recent percutaneous biopsy.  There is moderate proximal
 intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
 The common duct measures 10 mm at the level of the pancreatic head.  The
 pancreatic duct is mildly enlarged in the pancreatic head measuring 5 mm.  A
 12 x 19 mm left adrenal nodule is again identified and is of intermediate
 density on non-contrast imaging.  The mass however is unchanged from prior
 scan of [**2178-11-24**].

 Note is made of an 8-mm hyperenhancing density peripherally in segment V of
 the right lobe of liver.  This lesion does not demonstrate washout on the
 delayed phase and likely represents a perfusion abnormality.  The gallbladder
 tumor mass is closely related to segment VI of the liver; however, there is no
 evidence of frank infiltration of the liver parenchyma.

 Both kidneys are normal in size and enhance symmetrically.  Of note, a 10 x
 15mm cyst in the right kidney  was present on the prior study of [**2178**] and is
 unchanged.

 CT OF PELVIS:  Note is made of a calcified exophytic fibroid arising from the
 posterior aspect of the uterus.  There are no pathologically enlarged inguinal
 or retroperitoneal or pelvic sidewall lymph node.  Normal appearance of the
 sigmoid colon and rectum.  There is generalised subcutaneous soft tissue edema
 with fluid collecting in the right flank lateral to the abdominal wall
 musculature (6:62).

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Grade I anterior spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 is noted.
 Degenerative changes are seen involving the facet joints of the lower lumbar
 spine:  No lytic or sclerotic bone lesions are identified.  Changes in the
 left and right humeral heads are suggestive of prior glenohumeral
 dislocations.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Gallbladder enlargement with mural thickening and hyperenhancement in
 keeping with a gallbladder carcinoma. The mass is closely related to the first
 and second parts of duodenum, transverse colon and right lobe of the liver.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 611**] [**Name (STitle) 8814**] performed the procedure. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 63**],
 attending radiologist was  supervising.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a guide wire was
 advanced through the indwelling left arm PICC line, and subsequently into the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The old PICC line was then removed and a
 peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.  A new double lumen PICC
 line measuring 52 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of
 the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a
 new double lumen PICC line.  Final internal length is 52 cm, with the tip
 positioned in the SVC.  The line is ready to use.

 INDICATION:  78-year-old male patient with PICC line, required for antibiotic
 administration.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  A left-sided PICC line is identified and seen
 to reach into the mid portion of the right atrium.  It is recommended to
 withdraw the line by 5 cm to accomplish a termination in the lower SVC.  In
 comparison with the next preceding chest examination of [**2108-2-6**], no
 other significant interval changes can be identified.  Right-sided subclavian
 central venous line remains in unchanged position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  78-year-old man with respiratory failure.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2108-1-31**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were obtained from the chest with the
 administration of IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformats were generated and
 reviewed.

 NOTE: Patient had contrast extravasation of approximately 70mL. The infusion
 was stopped immediately and the catheter removed. Radiologist was called and
 examined the patient. The patient had adequate peripheral pulses. Since the
 infiltrate was greater than 30mL, plastic surgery resident on call, Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 6373**], was notified at 10:30pm on [**2108-2-4**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], physician taking
 care of the patient in the trauma SICU,was also notified of the results at
 11am on [**2108-2-4**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST:  An endotracheal tube ends approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  A left picc is noted. NG tube is present.

 Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathologic
 enlargement.  There is no acute aortic injury.  Atherosclerotic calcification
 is noted within the coronary vessels as well as within the aortic valve.
 There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

 There is no evidence of large central pulmonary embolism within limitation of
 suboptimal contrast bolus.

 There are bilateral basilar opacifications, left greater than right, which
 likely represent atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process such as

 pneumonia (especially on the left) cannot be completely excluded and should be
 considered in the correct clinical setting.  Ground-glass opacities
 predominantly in the apical segment of the right lobe and also within the left
 lobe are again noted, unchanged from [**2108-1-31**] and may represent edema,
 hemorrhage, or infection. A calcified granuloma is noted within the right
 lung.

 This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  Within this
 limitation, there is no definite evidence of abnormality in the upper
 abdominal structures. Hyperdensity within the gallbladder may reflect billiary
 excretion of contrast.

 Visualized osseous structures show multilevel degenerative changes.  There are
 no acute fractures identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism within limitation of suboptimal
 bolus. No acute aortic injury.
 2. Bibasilar opacifications likely represent atelectasis, left greater than
 right.  However, underlying infectious process, especially on the left cannot
 be completely excluded and should be considered in the correct clinical
 setting.
 3. Ground-glass opacities predominantly in the apical segment of the right
 lobe and also within the left lobe are again noted, unchanged from [**2108-1-31**] and may represent edema, hemorrhage, or infection.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**2-22**], there are continued low lung
 volumes.  Radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema persists, though slightly
 less prominent than on the previous study.  Coalescence of opacification at
 the right base again could represent a supervening pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting, though it also could be a manifestation of
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  The tip of the endotracheal tube remains well
 above the clavicular level.  Nasogastric tube and right subclavian catheter

 HISTORY:  Ventilator-assisted pneumonia, question interval change.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-18**] through 27:

 Right lower lobe consolidation which developed between [**2-18**] and 26 and
 subsequently worsened has improved.  Whether this is pneumonia or asymmetric
 edema is hard to say since the right heart obscures much of the region on
 today's rotated examination, and borderline interstitial edema has been
 present throughout the left lung.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is chronic.
 Mediastinal veins are persistently dilated.  Tip of the endotracheal tube at
 the upper margin of the clavicles is no less than 5 cm from the carina and
 could be advanced 2 cm for more secured seating.  Right subclavian line ends
 in the mid SVC and nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of
 view.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.

 HISTORY:  SAH on pressors, to assess for change.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**1-25**], the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Some prominence of the pulmonary vasculature persists,
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Mild asymmetry with
 opacification in the left perihilar region could reflect a developing
 consolidation at this if in the appropriate clinical setting.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the study of [**2-21**], there are lower lung volumes
 with increasing pulmonary edema.  An area of more coalescent opacification at
 the right base could possibly represent a supervening pneumonia.

 The endotracheal tube tip lies well above the clavicular level, approximately
 7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube and right subclavian catheter remain
 in place.

 superior vena cava.

 Again visualized is a moderate layering left pleural effusion as well as a
 small right pleural effusion.  Left basilar atelectasis appears unchanged.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.  There is no
 evidence of new consolidations, effusions, or pneumothoraces.

 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position.  Otherwise, little
 change in comparison to prior study from earlier today.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A 52-year-old with pancreatitis, hypotension,
 respiratory failure, check endotracheal tube position.

 COMPARISON:  [**2143-1-18**] at 0751 hours.

 Single portable upright chest film dated [**2143-1-19**] at 0917 hours is
 submitted.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at thoracic inlet, approximately 5.0-5.5 cm
 above the carina.  Left subclavian central line with its tip in the proximal
 SVC, unchanged.  There is a large caliber tubular structure overlying the left
 lateral neck with its tip overlying the region of the aortic knob.  A phone
 discussion with the patient's nurse, [**Doctor First Name 34514**], on [**2143-1-19**] at 1:10 p.m.
 confirms that this is not an intravascular catheter as no catheters have been
 placed since the previous chest of [**2143-1-18**].  Therefore, this likely is
 extrinsic to the patient.  Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There is a persistent hazy opacity at the left base with associated
 retrocardiac opacity which likely reflects a combination of pleural fluid and
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2143-1-19**].

 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 5.4 cm above the carina,
 and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.  Apparent asymmetry
 of the tube with respect to the trachea lumen probably reflects rotation.
 Large left layering pleural effusion has increased in size, and a small to
 moderate right pleural effusion has also developed.  Diffuse haziness of upper
 abdomen suggests possible ascites but is not specific for this finding.

 STUDY:  CT of the torso without contrast.

 INDICATION:  52-year-old female with pancreatitis, presenting now with
 tachycardia and fever, question necrotizing pancreatitis.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2143-1-11**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed from
 the level of the thoracic inlet to the proximal femur without administration
 of IV or oral contrast.  Multiplanar reconstructions were performed and
 reviewed.

 TOTAL EXAM DLP:  557.97 mGy-cm.

 The patient is intubated with ET tube tip 5 cm above the carina.  There is a
 left subclavian line with its tip terminating in the BC-SVC junction.
 Evaluation of vascular structures and cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1443**] is limited due to lack
 of IV contrast.  There are a few mildly prominent pretracheal and paratracheal
 lymph nodes (2:20).  No definite hilar lymphadenopathy is seen, although
 evaluation is limited due to lack of IV contrast.  There is mild pericardial
 thickening versus small effusion.

 Note is made of bilateral pleural effusions left larger than right.

 There is compressive atelectasis involving the lower lobes bilaterally.
 Within the visualized lungs, there are no masses seen.  There is mild
 interlobular septal thickening likely related to edema.  There is no obvious
 abnormality involving the tracheobronchial tree.

 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:

 Evaluation of solid visceral organs is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
 The liver demonstrates no obvious focal abnormalities.  There is no intra- or
 extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

 The spleen, right adrenal gland and kidneys appear grossly within normal
 limits.  There is again noted slight globular left adrenal gland which
 continues to retain its adreniform shape.

 Evaluation of the pancreas is limited due to lack of IV contrast.  There is
 again noted a large coarse calcification involving the pancreatic tail

 unchanged in appearance since previous study.  There is mild peripancreatic
 fat stranding.  The fluid adjacent to the pancreas has decreased since
 previous study although there continues to be a small pocket of fluid anterior
 to the neck and body of the pancreas in the lesser sac measuring about 4.9 x
 2.4 cm in size.  There is stable-appearing lymph node just superior to the
 body of the pancreas (2, 57) which measures about 1.4 cm in short axis.  The
 pancreatic duct is nondilated.

 The PEG tube is again seen.  There is slight mucosal edema involving the body
 of the stomach.

 Gallbladder is slightly distended although no significant inflammatory changes
 are seen.

 Evaluation of bowel is limited due to lack of enteric contrast.  There is a
 punctate high-density measuring about 9 x 4 mm at the base of the appendix.
 This high density was not seen on the previous study.  This could be related
 to ingested contrast and an appendicolith at this location is considered less
 likely.  The appendix does fill in with some increased density material as
 well.  There are no periappendiceal fat stranding.  The appendiceal wall is
 not thickened.

 There is minimal amount of pelvic ascites which appears slightly increased
 since previous study.

 The bladder is collapsed with Foley in place.

 There is no evidence of retroperitoneal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.

 Osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes without suspicious
 osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions.  There is small indeterminate left mid
 kidney low-attenuation lesion.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions left
 larger than right.

 Left subclavian line with its tip in the BC-SVC and needs to be repositioned.

 Interval decrease in peripancreatic fluid collections.  Persistent fluid
 collection in the lesser sac.

 Prominent peripancreatic lymph nodes which are stable since previous study,
 likely reactive.

 COMPARISON:  [**2143-1-11**] at 09:42.

 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient's chin overlies the right apex, partially obscuring the view.  There
 has been interval placement of a left subclavian central venous catheter,
 terminating at the proximal SVC.  There is a thin linear density projecting
 over the lateral left upper hemithorax which is felt to be artifactual, less
 likely pneumothorax.  Repeat chest radiograph could be obtained for
 confirmation.  Otherwise there is no evidence of large pneumothorax.  Left
 base opacity could be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or infection.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.

 The above findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14027**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3547**] in
 person on [**2143-1-11**] at 11:10 a.m.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Motor vehicle trauma with multiple fractures in the pelvis.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images from the lung apices to the
 pubic symphysis were acquired with intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reconstructions were performed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No acute aortic injury is
 identified, with the thoracic aorta normal in caliber.  The great vessels
 appear unremarkable as does the heart, with a trace amount of pericardial
 fluid seen anteriorly.  There is no pleural effusion.  No mediastinal, hilar,
 or axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  A pacer is noted with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.

 Lung window images demonstrate extensive paraseptal emphysema within the lung
 apices.  No areas of focal consolidation are present.  The airways are patent
 to level of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally. No pneumothorax is present.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder,
 pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, stomach, and loops of
 large and small bowel are unremarkable.  The abdominal aorta is normal in
 caliber.  There is no free air or free fluid.  Portal vein is patent.  No
 intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is seen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Hematoma is noted within the
 space of Retzius, which tracks into the extraperitoneal spaces of the pelvis,
 adjacent to fractures of the superior and inferior pubic rami.  No contrast
 extravasation is identified, however, the bladder is not well distended with
 contrast.  There is no intraperitoneal free fluid identified.  Prostatic
 calcifications are noted within the prostate which is otherwise unremarkable.

 (Cont)
 Distal ureters are intact.  The pelvic loops of bowel are within normal
 limits.  There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy identified.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There is a nondisplaced fracture of the spinous process of L3
 as well as comminuted fractures of both superior pubic rami, and right
 inferior pubic ramus. There is additionally a segmental fracture of the right
 inferior pubic ramus. A non-displaced fracture of the left inferior pubic
 ramus is also demonstrated.   A nondisplaced right sacral fracture is also
 noted (series 2, image 102).  No compression deformities are noted within the
 thoracolumbar spine.  There is mild grade 1 L4 on L5 anterolisthesis with
 bilateral pars defects noted, which appears chronic.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extraperitoneal hematoma involving the space of Retzius with no areas of
 active contrast extravasation.  However, extraperitoneal bladder injury cannot
 be excluded on this study and a CT cystogram is recommended for further
 evaluation.
 2.  Multiple pelvic fractures as described including bilateral superior and
 inferior pubic rami fractures, and a right sacral fracture which is
 nondisplaced.
 3.  Fracture of the spinous process of L3, which appears nondisplaced.
 4.  No traumatic injury seen within the chest or abdomen.

 PICC LINE EXCHANGE / REPOSITIONING

 INDICATION:  Malposition of indwelling PICC line, reposition existing PICC
 line.

 The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 912**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1886**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
 was the attending radiologist who supervised.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a guidewire was
 advanced through the indwelling right arm PICC line, and subsequently into the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The old PICC line was then removed and a
 peel-away sheath was then placed over the guidewire. A new single-lumen PICC
 line measuring 54 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of
 the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured
 to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a
 new 4-French single-lumen PICC line. Final internal length is 54 cm, with the
 tip positioned in the SVC. The line is ready to use.

 effect of aspiration.  Right hilar adenopathy has increased.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A bulging
 mediastinal contour in the region of the ascending aorta could be due to
 adenopathy or a tortuous or dilated aorta.  Right subclavian infusion port
 ends low in the SVC.

 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from [**2122-10-9**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.

 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 Patchy left lower lung opacity, probably within the lingula, suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring that appears unchanged.  Focal pleural thickening at
 the right lung apex is also stable.  On the right there is an unchanged nipple
 shadow that can be visualized.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are similar along the mid
 thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.

 INDICATION:  61-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with
 current right groin access.  Please discontinue right groin access and place
 new permanent tunneled line axis.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3084**] [**Name (STitle) 3085**] (fellow), Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 14756**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14757**]
 (resident), and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 723**] [**Name (STitle) 344**] (attending physician) performed the
 procedure.  The attending physician was present and supervised throughout the
 procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
 100 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time
 of 1 hour 30 minutes, during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored.

 PROCEDURE:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient after
 explaining the risks, benefits, and alternatives.  The patient was brought to
 the angiographic suite and laid supine on the table.  The right and left necks
 along with left groin were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A
 preprocedural huddle and timeout were performed per [**Hospital1 14**] protocol.  Initial
 ultrasound demonstrated the presence of occlusion of the right and left
 internal jugular veins.  On this ultrasound there was no connection
 demonstrated between the left external jugular to the subclavian or
 brachiocephalic vein.  A decision was made to access the left subclavian vein
 to place the tunneled dialysis line.  Patent left subclavian vein was accessed
 with micropuncture needle under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance.  A
 micropuncture wire was passed through and the needle was exchanged for a
 micropuncture sheath.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 471**] was attempted to pass into the superior vena
 cava, but due to the tortuosity of the vessel it was unable to pass the wire
 into the SVC.  A 4 French C2 glide catheter was advanced over super stiff
 glide after the tract was dilated with a 6 French dilator.  The catheter was
 used to direct the wire into the IVC.  The catheter was then extended into the
 IVC and the Glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz.  Now, attention was
 directed towards the left chest wall.  After appropriate measurements were
 taken, tunnel was created with a tunneling device and appropriate numbing with
 lidocaine and lidocaine with epinephrine.  Serial dilation of the tract was
                                                             (Over)

 performed with 12 and 14 French dilators.  A peel-away sheath was placed over
 the Amplatz wire.  The inner dilator was removed and the catheter was fed into
 the peel-away sheath over the Amplatz wire.  Once the catheter was in place,
 the sheath was peeled away and Amplatz wire was removed.  The venotomy site
 was closed with 4-0 Vicryl and the catheter was secured to the skin with 0
 silk sutures.  Secured dressings were applied.

 The attention was now directed to the left groin with a temporary hemodialysis
 line was removed and hemostasis was achieved by manual compression for 5
 minutes.

 Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient had pain in his right leg, which
 was unrelated to the procedure and had been complaining of pain throughout the
 procedure.  There were no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Successful uncomplicated placement of left subclavian 14.5 French 31 cm
 tip-to-cuff tunneled hemodialysis line.  The tip is in the right atrium.  The
 line is ready to use.

 2.  Successful uncomplicated removal of 12 French temporary hemodialysis line

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2119-11-27**].

 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is mild cephalization of the
 pulmonary vasculature which is suggestive of increased pulmonary venous
 pressures.  The lungs are clear.  Rightward deviation of the trachea in the
 superior mediastinum is unchanged and due to the patient's known history of
 thyromegaly.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  A hemodialysis catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 Again noted are multiple old left rib fractures as well as degenerative
 changes of the bilateral glenohumeral joints.

 IMPRESSION: Mild cephalization which could reflect mild pulmonary venous
 congestion.

 CTA OF THE HEAD:
 A small, 2 mm, broad based aneurysm is noted in the left M1 bifurcation.
 Otherwise, the intracranial internal carotid, vertebrobasilar and anterior,
 middle and posterior cerebral arteries are patent with normal contrast
 enhancement and branching pattern.  There is no evidence of stenosis,
 occlusion or arteriovenous malformation.

 CTA OF THE NECK:

 The origins of the common carotid and vertebral arteries are patent without
 significant stenosis.  There is bilateral calcified atherosclerotic plaque
 noted at the carotid bifurcation, but no significant stenosis of the proximal
 internal cerebral artery segment.  Otherwise, the common, internal and
 external carotid arteries are normal in appearance.  There is no evidence of
 hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection.

 The patient is status post sternotomy with two drainage catheters placed in
 the anterior mediastinum.  There are multiple small air subcutaneus areas,
 extending from the anterior mediastinum along the cervical fascial planes.
 There are, however, no adjacent fluid collections that would raise the concern
 for abscess.
 Note is also made of minimal right pleural effusion and bilateral atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. No CT evidence of territorial infarct.

 2. Bilateral atherosclerotic disease involving the common carotid artery
 bifurcations, but no evidence of significant stenosis in the cervical or
 intracranial vasculature.

 3. Incidential finding of a left 2 mm M1 bifurcation aneurysm.

 INDICATION:  53-year-old male with respiratory distress, now with fever and
 hypoxia.

 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA dated [**2117-12-18**]  No CT comparison available for the
 abdomen and pelvis.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:  An endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea.  An esophageal
 catheter terminates in the stomach.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions and extensive opacity within the lower lobes which has progressed
 with some associated with volume loss on the right.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  Right internal jugular line is seen, terminating in the region of
 the cavoatrial junction.  No lymph nodes in the axilla, mediastinal or hilar
 regions meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.

 This study is not tailored for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries, but
 bilateral pulmonary emboli are present.  A large thrombus straddles the
 bifurcation of the left main pulmonary artery.  On the right, there is a
 thrombus within the a right lower lobar artery (2:25).

 ABDOMEN:  Contrast timing is suboptimal for evaluation of intra-abdominal
 structures.  Within this limitation, the liver, spleen, gallbladder, atrophic
 pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, small bowel, and colon are within
 normal limits.  The appendix is unremarkable.  There is no free
 intraperitoneal air or ascites.

 PELVIS:  A Foley catheter is seen within a decompressed bladder.  There is a
 prostatic calcification.  The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.  No
 free fluid is seen.

 No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are detected.  Arterial calcifications
 are seen.

 INDICATION:  40-year-old male with ulcerative colitis and PSC, continued
 hematocrit drop.

 Correlation to chest CT from [**2200-2-4**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical MDCT images were acquired through the torso without
 intravenous and with oral contrast, due to the patient's rising creatinine of
 1.5 and primary concern for hematoma detection.  Therefore, evaluation of the
 viscera is suboptimal.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:  A large right simple pleural effusion has increased in size.  There is
 worsening right lower lobe collapse.  The right upper and middle lobes are
 clear.  Scattered calcified granulomata are present.

 New faint ground-glass opacities scattered throughout the left upper lobe and
 lingula are consistent with developing pneumonia.  A small simple left pleural
 effusion has developed, with mild compressive atelectasis.  9 mm nodular
 opacity in the right middle lobe likely represents focal atelectasis.

 Left subclavian catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction.  The
 heart is normal in size, without trace pericardial effusion.  Mediastinal and
 hilar lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged.

 ABDOMEN:  There is a large amount of simple ascites in the abdomen,
 concentrated in the perihepatic and perisplenic spaces.  No hyperdense fluid
 is seen to suggest hematoma.

 The liver is enlarged, coarse, and nodular, consistent with cirrhosis.
 Subcapsular area of fluid density and calcification in the right lobe likely
 refelcts old infarct or hematoma.  There is moderate to severe biliary
 dilation, with multiple areas of stricturing, consistent with primary
                                                             (Over)

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates near
 the thoracic inlet, approximately 6 cm above the carina.  The balloon is not
 well seen.  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for technique, the cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are probably within normal range.  The lungs
 appear clear.  The extreme left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, but
 there is no evidence for pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat high-lying endotracheal tube, about 6 cm above the
 carina.  If clinically indicated, advancing the tube slightly could be
 considered for more optimal positioning; the balloon is also not well seen and
 could accordingly be deflated potentially.

 intubated, check endotracheal tube placement.

 Comparison to prior study of [**2152-10-29**] at 8:11 a.m.

 Portable semi-erect chest film [**2152-10-29**] at 8:32 is submitted.

 IMPRESSION:

 Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip 5 cm above the
 carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen now coursing below the diaphragm with its
 tip not identified on this study.  There is persistent diffuse interstitial
 abnormality, consistent with the known history of IPF.  More focal patchy
 opacity at the right base and a more consolidative process in the left lower
 lung persists and is concerning for superimposed pneumonia or aspiration.  No
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips overlying the right mid lung are again seen.
 Interval resolution of gastric distension given placement of the nasogastric
 tube.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  83-year-old status post motor vehicle accident with
 multiple rib fractures, status post chest tube placement.  Evaluate for
 changes in pneumonia and effusions.

 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of [**2105-10-16**] at 4:38.

 Single portable AP upright chest film dated [**2105-10-17**] at 9:24 is submitted.

 Impression:

 Interval removal of the left basilar chest tube.  No definite pneumothorax is
 seen.  There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving the
 left neck and lateral chest wall soft tissues.  Interval appearance of linear
 opacity at the left base may reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  The
 interstitium is somewhat prominent, most likely reflects slightly lower lung
 volumes on the current examination in combination with age related change
 and/or small airways disease.  The left anterolateral third through sixth rib
 fractures are better visualized on CT but some of them can be visualized on
 the current examination.  Few scattered calcified nodular opacities at both
 apices are again seen and likely reflect calcified granulomas.  Degenerative
 changes of the left glenohumeral joint are also seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.

 INDICATION:  60-year-old male patient status post bronchoscopy and right VATS
 biopsy x3 on [**2152-10-23**].  Evaluate for possible pneumothorax post chest tube
 removal.

 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral projections.  Frontal view is analyzed in direct
 comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained five
 hours earlier on the same day.  No evidence of pneumothorax as before.
 Densities in the left lower lobe area and left lung mid field appear stable.
 No new infiltrates are identified.  The lateral view demonstrates that the
 left lower lobe densities are preferentially located in the posterior portions
 of the left lower lobe.  When the comparison is made with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of [**2152-10-18**] the location of the
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are practically identical but on today's
 examination the patient's ability to make an inspiratory effort is much less.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax development on second followup
 examination.  Mostly left lower lobe infiltrates are of chronic appearance as
 they existed on multiple previous portable and PA lateral chest examinations.
 No evidence of new abnormalities.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

 Lordotic positioning.  A tracheostomy tube is in place.  A right subclavian
 central line is present, tip over mid SVC PICC line.  No pneumothorax
 detected.

 Compared with [**2123-3-19**], I doubt significant interval change. There is
 background hyperinflation.  Again seen is increased opacity at the left base,
 with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  An associated small left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  There is asymmetric upper zone redistribution, more
 pronounced on the left, without overt CHF.  The extreme right costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the film.  Vertical linear opacity projecting over the
 left upper zone may represent a skin fold.

 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and suspected small
 left pleural effusion, stable compared with [**2123-3-19**] at 3:23 a.m.

 decreased, with crowding of bronchovascular markings, but no focal
 consolidation.  Heart size is top normal, with a left ventricular
 configuration.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Again noted are multiple
 prominent colonic loops in the upper abdomen, but no evidence of free air.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  83-year-old intubated with feeding tube coiled in back
 of throat, assess nasogastric tube placement.

 Comparison to prior study dated [**2123-3-13**] at 4:25.

 Portable semi-erect chest film [**2123-3-15**] at 12:21 is submitted.  The right
 lateral thorax is not entirely included on the study.

 IMPRESSION:

 Left subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC, unchanged.
 There is a Dobbhoff feeding tube which has its tip within the stomach but just
 below the gastroesophageal junction.  It may be prudent to advance the tube
 somewhat to be sure that it is not near the GE junction.  The endotracheal
 tube now appears to lie approximately 7 cm above the carina but this may be
 related to the lordotic technique on the current examination. Consolidation at
 the left lung base may represent an area of pneumonia with associated pleural
 effusion, less likely atelectasis given the lack of interval change.  There is
 pulmonary venous hypertension with a suggestion of some superimposed mild
 interstitial edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 unchanged given marked patient rotation on the current examination.

 Left PICC extends to the upper SVC.  There is no appreciable pneumothorax.
 Air is noted in the left chest wall soft tissues, as appreciate on prior CT.
 There is volume loss and atelectasis at the left lung base with associated
 small pleural effusion seen on the lateral view.  Aeration here is minimally
 improved from prior study.  There is no new opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 There is no right effusion.  The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 There is no pulmonary edema at present.  Calcification of the aorta are again
 seen.  Known left rib fractures are poorly demonstrated though adjacent
 pleural thickening is noted.  Prominent air-filled viscus in the upper abdomen
 is likely transverse colon.

 IMPRESSION:  Slightly improved aeration at the left base, where there is
 persistent atelectasis and small effusion.  No pneumothorax, evidence of
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

 FINDINGS:

 A right-sided chest tube is in place with the tip of the chest tube near the
 right apex.  A tiny right apical pneumothorax is present.  There is marked
 increased left lower, and left upper lobe consolidation.  Surgical clips with
 chain sutures are seen in the right lower lobe with some surrounding
 opacification that can be due to hemorrhage.  Fibrotic changes are present at
 the right base, little changed.  Mild interstitial edema may be present.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions could be present but are difficult to
 evaluate.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax with right-sided chest tube in place.

 2.  Increased left lower and left upper lung consolidation worrisome for
 infection.

 3.  Increased opacity around the right lower lobe biopsy site worrisome for
 hemorrhage around the biopsy site.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute desaturation.  Patient with baseline dyspnea.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

 Increased opacity in the left lower lobe and left perihilar regions are a
 combination of pleural effusion and consolidation.  The consolidation could be
 due to atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion is stable.
 Right lower lobe opacities have increased consistent with increasing
 atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Surgical clips are
 again noted in the right mid hemithorax.  There is no evident pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  These abnormalities are
 superimposed on known chronic interstitial lung disease.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed 11 hours
 earlier.

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right-sided PICC line with
 tip terminating in the distal SVC.  Stable positioning of the left-sided
 central venous line with tip terminating in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax
 evident.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube with
 placement of tracheostomy noted.  Increased perihilar and bibasilar opacities
 concerning for worsening pulmonary edema, particularly on the left.  Left
 basilar opacity likely reflects combination of small left pleural effusion and
 left atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC line with tip terminating in the distal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax. Worsening pulmonary edema with small left pleural effusion.

 The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and might be advanced 10-15 cm.
 Diffuse narrowing of the trachea might be consistent with saber sheet
 configuration. Upper mediastinal enlargement of thyroid cannot be excluded.

 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Prominence of the bilateral vasculature is

 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph [**2116-4-5**].

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The right PICC tip projects over the upper SVC.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours unchanged from the prior examination.
 The tracheostomy tube is noted to be aligned perpendicular with respect to the
 trachea.  Increased opacification at the left lung base likely represents
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Additionally,
 retrocardiac opacification may represent layering pleural effusion with
 compressive atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia cannot
 be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Minimal right-sided
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Minimal opacification of the right lung
 base may represent atelectasis.

 the trachea. The position needs to be re-evaluated. Findings were discussed
 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 868**] at 14:21 on [**2123-4-7**] via telephone.
 2. Retrocardiac opacification is again noted which may represent layering
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis; however, infectious process
 such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.

 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, [**2123-4-4**].

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Borderline cardiomegaly is again noted.
 Opacification at the left lung base consistent with pleural effusion and
 adjacent compressive atelectasis appears improved since most recent prior
 examination of [**2123-4-4**].  Underlying infectious process cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Minimal opacification in
 right lung base may represent atelectasis.  The right PICC tip projects over
 the expected region of the mid SVC.  The tracheostomy tube appears slightly
 angulated with respect to the trachea and needs to be repositioned.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy tube is malaligned with respect to the trachea, position
 needs to be reevaluated.  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 868**] at 14:21 on
 [**2123-3-25**] via telephone.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacification may represent pleural effusion with adjacent

 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  These findings are improved since
 most recent prior examination.

 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 Compared with [**2123-3-25**] at 4:11 a.m., I doubt significant interval change.  A
 tracheostomy is in place, unchanged.  A right subclavian central line tip
 overlies the distal SVC, unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified.

 Again seen is cardiomegaly; prominence of the pulmonary arteries with a
 tapered appearance, consistent with pulmonary hypertension;  upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring;  left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, probably with a small left effusion.  There is minimal patchy
 opacity at the right base, ? atelectasis.  Relative lucency to the right of
 the spine and lower pneumomediastinum is noted, question artifact due to
 overlap of pulmonary artery with right cardiac shadow.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could represent a deep sulcus sign. However, no other
 evidence of pneumothorax is identified and the finding has been unchanged
 compared with multiple prior films including [**2123-3-24**] at 4:20 a.m.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:

 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse
 calcifications and mild unfolding.  There is mild perihilar haziness and
 vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  3 mm
 calcification in the left mid lung field is compatible with a calcified
 granuloma.  Ill-defined hazy opacification within the left lung base may
 reflect an area of atelectasis but developing infection is not excluded.  A
 small left pleural effusion is noted.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute

 atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-14**]:

 Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left upper lobe
 posterior segmental atelectasis seen on the chest CT [**8-14**], is probably still
 present.  A band of atelectasis in the right mid lung is probably unchanged.
 Heart is mildly enlarged, a mediastinum that is greatly widened due to fat
 deposition.  Of note, the CTA showed likely a substantial
 tracheobronchomalacia, although this study was not designed for that
 determination.

 ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements.  No appreciable
 pleural abnormality.

 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 2.4 cm above the carina.  Bibasilar opacities are
 atelectasis on subsequent chest CT.  Widening of the mediastinum is due to
 mediastinal lipomatosis on subsequent CT.  The nasogastric tube within the
 esophagus is displaced to the right, ending in the stomach, with the side port
 at the gastroesophageal junction.  There is no effusion or large pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube ends 2.4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old man with dyspnea.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 embolism or dissection.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2118-8-14**].  The patient's true identity is not
 known at the time of reporting.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was performed
 before and after administration of 100 mL Omnipaque intravenous contrast.
 Multiplanar reformation images are submitted for review.

 CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The thoracic aorta is normal
 in caliber without acute intramural hematoma or dissection.  Pulmonary
 arterial vasculature is visualized to the subsegmental level without filling
 defect to suggest pulmonary embolism.  No pathologically enlarged axillary,
 mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified, ranging up to 9 mm in the
 prevascular space.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal
 limits.  A small amount of air in the left brachiocephalic vein is likely
 related to injection.  There is no pericardial effusion. There is mediastinal
 lipomatosis as well as prominent pericardial and epipericaridal fat. Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions. The esophagus slightly deviates to the right.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule or mass.  Subsegmental
 linear atelectasis is seen in the superior segment of the left upper lobe as
 well as at the lung bases bilaterally.  There is no pneumonia.  The
 endotracheal tube ends in the mid trachea.  A nasogastric tube ends in the
 stomach.

 The lower trachea is collapsed onto the endotracheal tube, suggesting possible
 tracheobronchomalacia.

 The study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.  The visualized
 portions of the liver, stomach and spleen are normal. Nasogastric tube ends in
 the stomach.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No bone finding suspicious for infection or malignancy is seen.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  35-year-old woman with altered mental status.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT axial images were acquired through the head.
 Subsequently, helical images were obtained through the brain with intravenous
 contrast in the arterial phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
 obtained and reviewed.  Maximum intensity projection, volume rendered images,
 and curved reformats were generated in the imaging lab and reviewed.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  Within the left temporoparietal lobe, there is a large
 confluent area of hypodensity compatible with infarction in the distribution
 of the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery.  It is well
 marginated, subacute in appearance.  Additionally, there is a small amount of
 hypodensity in the pons (2:9).  There is no evidence of hemorrhage and no
 shift of normally midline structures.  Prominent ventricles and sulci are
 compatible with global age-related volume loss.  The basal cisterns are
 patent.  No osseous abnormality is identified.  Hypoattenuation in the
 subcortical and periventricular white matter is likely sequelae of chronic
 microvascular ischemic disease.

 CTA HEAD AND NECK:  There is severe stenosis or occlusion of the inferior
 division of the left middle cerebral artery at the MCA bifurcation. The right
 A1 is small. A dominant left A1 supplies the bilateral A2 segments.

 (Cont)
 Irregularity in the basilar artery is likely due to intracranial
 atherosclerosis.  The right supraclinoid ICA is narrowed.

 There is no evidence of aneurysm, dissection, or significant stenosis in the
 carotid or vertebral arteries bilaterally.  The distal cervical right ICA
 measures 4mm and distal cervical left ICA measures 4 mm.  The left vertebral
 artery originates from the aortic arch, normal variant.

 Mucosal thickening is seen in the left maxillary sinus.  Small lymph nodes in
 the neck are not enlarged by CT size criteria.  No nodules are seen in the
 thyroid gland.  A 4-mm right apical nodule (4:86) and a 3-mm left apical
 pulmonary nodule (4:72) are noted.

 CT PERFUSION:  There is increased mean transit time with decreased blood flow
 and blood volume in the distribution of the inferior division of the left
 middle cerebral artery. Low blood flow and low blood volume have been reported
 to be characteristic of completed infarction.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extensive completed infarction in the left parietotemporal lobe,
 encompassing more than one-third of the MCA territory. Hypodensity in the pons
 is nonspecific, but may represent another focus of infarct. No evidence of
 hemorrhage.

 2.  Probable occlusion of the inferior division of the left middle cerebral
 artery at the bifurcation.

 3.  Evidence of intracranial atherosclerotic disease in the basilar artery
 with narrowing of the right supraclinoid artery.

 4. 4mm pulmonary nodules. If the patient has no risk factors for malignancy,
 no follow up is needed. If there is no prior imaging documenting stability and
 if the patient has risk factors for malignancy, follow up with dedicated chest
 CT  is recommended in 12 months.

 left-sided congestive heart failure or lung infection or both superimposed on
 severe pulmonary fibrosis.

 ET tube is in standard position.  Heart size cannot be assessed because of
 adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormalities.  No pneumothorax.  Nasogastric
 tube passes to the distal stomach and out of view.

 change.

 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of [**2152-10-26**] at 605,
 [**2152-10-24**] at 2043.

 A single portable AP upright chest film [**2152-10-28**] at 5 a.m. is submitted.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Diffuse interstitial abnormality is seen in this patient with known
 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  In addition, there is more focal airspace
 consolidation in the left mid and lower lung and at the right base which has
 worsened since [**10-24**] raising concern for a superimposed pneumonia,
 aspiration, or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the overlying
 diffuse airspace process.

 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs from [**2105-10-18**] dating back to
 [**2105-10-15**].

 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Evaluation is somewhat limited due to the
 markedly lordotic and rotated position of the patient, low lung volumes, and
 extensive soft tissue scatter artifact.  No pneumothorax after chest tube
 removal is seen.  There is bibasilar atelectasis and possible bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is widening of the mediastinum due to engorgement of
 mediastinal veins.

 There is air within the esophagus and markedly distension of the stomach and
 multiple small visible small bowel loops in the upper abdomen.  These findings
 are new on this study.  Again noted is stable subcutaneous emphysema over the
 soft tissues of the left hemithorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 2.  Persistent pulmonary venous hypertension.
 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis and possible small effusions.

 INDICATION:  53-year-old man with respiratory failure.  Please evaluate for
 pulmonary embolism.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were acquired through the chest with and without IV
 contrast.  Multiplanar reformations were obtained and reviewed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:

 The thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There is no axillary or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.  The heart and great vessels are
 unremarkable.  No pericardial effusions are present.  The pulmonary arteries
 are patent down to the subsegmental levels.

 The lungs show bilateral left greater than right lower lobe atelectasis.  No
 effusions are present.  No consolidations or nodules are present either.

 Although this examination is not intended for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the
 partially imaged abdomen is unremarkable.  An NG tube in the stomach
 appropriately.  An ET tube terminates in the mid thoracic trachea
 appropriately.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:

 The visible osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions or
 fractures.

 IMPRESSION:

 Left greater than right lower lobe opacities most suggestive of substantial
 atelectasis.  No evidence for pulmonary embolism.

 HISTORY:  Patient intubated, question pneumonia.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-18**] through [**12-20**]:

 Opacification around the lower poles of both hila has been variable over the
 past several days.  It is improved in the left lower lobe, and remains
 relatively persistent on the right.  The variability suggests that this is
 largely atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded.  Upper lungs are grossly
 clear.  There is no longer any pulmonary edema, although heart size remains
 top normal and small pleural effusions could be present, though not
 appreciated.  ET is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:

 The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral lower lobe opacities which may
 represent atelectasis, although early pneumonia can not be excluded.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinal silhouette is
 widened, corresponding to mediastinal lipomatosis on the concurrently
 performed CT.  The NG tube and ET tube are in appropriate position.  The hilar
 contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.

 IMPRESSION:

 Bilateral lower lobe opacities in setting of low lung volumes favoring
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Clinical correlation advised.

 INDICATION:  PICC Positioning.

 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from [**2152-10-30**] at 04:30.

 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The new right PICC terminates
 approximately 2-3 cm below the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial
 junction, although evaluation is limited by the diffuse opacities obscuring
 the right mediastinal contour.  Otherwise, the endotracheal tube terminates 6
 cm above the carina and may be advanced 1 to 2 cm for more secure seating.
 There is overall stability in the diffuse opacification of the lungs with
 possible improvement in aeration of the left upper lung field.  The
 nasogastric tube is unchanged in position, seen coursing out of frame towards
 the stomach.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New right PICC terminating approximately 2-3 cm beyond the estimated
 location of the cavoatrial junction.
 2.  Minimally improved aeration of the left upper lung with otherwise
 unchanged multifocal opacities.

 COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT last performed on [**2118-9-26**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the
 brain.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage,
 edema, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 265**]-white
 matter interface is well preserved.  No evidence of acute major vascular
 territorial infarct.  The ventricles and sulci are proportionally enlarged,
 compatible with age-related involutional changes.  The extra-calvarial soft
 tissues show no evidence of trauma.  The bony calvarium and skull base are
 intact without fracture.  Sinus disease is noted in the left maxillary sinus
 and the right ethmoid air cells.  The visualized mastoid air cells are well
 aerated.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intracranial process.
 2.  Age-appropriate global atrophy.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  60-year-old man with recent biopsy, diagnosis of
 UIP/IPF, acute worsening hypoxia overnight requiring intubation.  Please
 evaluate for interval change or PE.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained without the use of
 intravenous contrast.  Subsequently, axial images were obtained after the
 uneventful administration of 100 mL Optiray intravenous contrast.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformatted images were constructed.

 FINDINGS:

 Non-contrast images demonstrate no evidence of intramural hematoma.  There is
 no pulmonary embolus.  The heart is enlarged.  Trace pericardial fluid is
 present.  Coronary artery calcifications and atherosclerotic calcifications in
 the aorta and proximal great vessels are noted.  The thyroid gland is within
 normal limits.

 The patient is intubated.  The airways are patent.  Gastric tube traverses the
 esophagus which is moderately dilated and air filled.  There is no axillary
 lymphadenopathy.

 There is similar substantial mediastinal lymphadenopathy with nodes measuring
 up to 19 mm.

 Compared to the prior examination, the lungs have significantly worsened in
 appearance.  Subpleural reticular opacities, much worse at the bases, with
 scattered ground-glass opacities persist, however, there has been interval
 worsening of patchy and confluent ground-glass opacities mixed with septal
 thickening at the bases.  In addition, in the lower lobes bilaterally, there
 are new focal areas of consolidation predominantly medially.  There are
 bilateral small pleural effusions.

 A mildly hyperdense splenic cyst is stable.  The patient is status post liver
 transplanation.  Otherwise, very limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.  Reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins may relate to
 injection rate although an element of right heart failure cannot be excluded.


 The main pulmonary artery measures 3.2 cm.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:

 There are no destructive osseous lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence for pulmonary embolus.

 2.  Bilateral reticular lung opacities and ground-glass opacities which are
 worse at the lung bases are consistent with biopsy proven IPF.  There are new
 superimposed ground-glass opacities and bibasilar consolidation most
 concerning for superimposed infection, pulmonary edema or ARDS.  The esophagus
 is somewhat dilated in appearance which may reflect dysmotility and could even
 with seen with collagen vascular diseases such as scleroderma in the

 3.  Similar moderate substantial mediastinal and bilateral hilar
 lymphadenopathy.

 4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.

 5.  Previously noted new splenic lesion is re-demonstrated with features
 consistent with cyst.

 6.  Enlarged main pulmonary artery concerning for pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.

 HISTORY:  76-year-old woman with elevated white count, hypotension, and
 worsening oxygenation.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to three radiographs on [**9-20**].

 In terms of acute changes, pulmonary vascular congestion has improved
 minimally.  Heart is still moderately enlarged and the left lower lobe is
 chronically opacified, presumably atelectasis.  There has been a slight
 increase in previous small left pleural effusion.  Right internal jugular line
 is at or just above the junction of brachiocephalic veins.  There is no
 pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  [**2197-8-10**].

 FINDINGS:

 Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened since prior exam with increased small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged.
 NG tube is in the stomach.  Bibasilar increased opacities i mostly compatible
 with dependent edema, superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded
 in appropriate clinical settings.  There is no pneumothorax.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Small bilateral pleural effusion
 has also increased.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities are probably compatible with dependent edema.
 Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in appropriate
 clinical settings.

 INDICATION:  53-year-old quadriplegic ventilator-dependent man with likely VAP
 with near whiteout of the left lung and increasing opacity on the right.
 Evaluate for pneumonia. Also with UTI and distended abdomen.

 COMPARISON:  CT [**2187-9-9**]; CT [**2180-12-27**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with 150 mL Omnipaque
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed with 5-mm
 slice thickness.

 CT CHEST: Lung window images demonstrate complete right lower lobe collapse,
 increased from [**2187-9-9**], without right pleural effusion. Mild peribronchial
 vascular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes may be due to infection
 or inflammation. The left lung is collapsed with mediastinal shift to the
 left. Mucus plugging is noted in the left lower lobe bronchus (2:28),
 calcifications suggests they may be chronic. A small left pleural effusion is
 unchanged from [**2187-9-9**] with pleural thickening and enhancement, which may be
 due to chronic inflammation, but superinfection or empyema cannot be excluded.
 The central airways are patent with a tracheostomy in place.

 A nasoenteric tube is in the esophagus, ending in the stomach.  No nodules are
 seen in the thyroid gland. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without
 evidence of dissection. The pulmonary artery trunk is enlarged to 4.2 cm
 suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is no axillary
 lymphadenopathy. Mediastinal lymph nodes are borderline enlarged, ranging up
 to 10 mm in the right upper paratracheal station (2:9). Intracardiac device
 leads end in the right atrium and right ventricle.  A right central venous
 catheter ends in the superior right atrium.  Coronary artery calcifications
 are of unknown hemodynamic significance.  A small pericardial effusion is
 within the physiologic range.

 CT ABDOMEN:  The liver is normal. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile
 duct dilation.  Hyperdensity within the gallbladder represents small layering
 stones and sludge.  Mild gallbladder wall thickening is nonspecific in the
 setting of adjacent inflammation and may be reactive, given the adjacent fluid
 collection.  A 7.2 x 8.6 x 8.9 cm loculated fluid collection with thin rim
 enhancement impresses on the colonic hepatic flexure at the site of prior
 thickening and inflammation (300A:29, 2:65).  The remainder of the colon
 appears normal without obstruction.

 (Cont)

 The spleen, pancreas and right adrenal gland are normal.  A 1.7-cm left
 adrenal nodule is incompletely characterized on this study but is new from
 [**2180**].  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly without
 hydronephrosis.

 The transverse colon is focally minimally dilated to 6.7cm without evidence of
 small or large bowel obstruction. There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 abdomen. No free intraperitoneal air. The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber
 throughout. An IVC filter is in place. The main portal vein, splenic vein and
 SMV are patent. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph
 nodes are identified. Atrophy of the paraspinal muscles is compatible with
 quadriplegia.  There is mild body wall edema.

 CT PELVIS:  The rectum is normal. The sigmoid is redundant with focal dilation
 to 11.1 cm, without definite obstruction. A suprapubic catheter is in the
 decompressed bladder.  The prostate is normal.  There is no free fluid and no
 pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No bone finding suspicious for infection or malignancy is seen.
 Mild superior endplate compression deformities in L1, L2, and L3 are unchanged
 from [**2187-9-9**].

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lung collapse with left lower lobe bronchial mucous plugging some of
 which appears chronic. Right lower lobe collapse.

 2.  Scattered peribronchovascular opacities in the right upper and middle
 lobes likely secondary to infection or inflammation.

 3.  Small left pleural effusion. Pleural thickening and hyperenhancement may
 be due to chronic inflammation, but superinfection or empyema cannot be
 excluded.

 4.  Organizing fluid collection at the hepatic flexure at site of prior
 inflammation. Given the focal nature, an underlying perforated mass cannot be
 excluded and colonoscopy is recommended when acute issues have resolved.

 5.  Cholelithiasis and sludge.  Mild gallbladder wall thickening is likely
 reactive given the adjacent fluid collection. If there is clinical concern for
 acute cholecystitis, ultrasound could be performed.

 6.  Indeterminate left adrenal nodule. When acute issues have resolved, this
 can be further evaluated with dedicated adrenal CT or MRI.

 7.  Enlarged pulmonary artery suggests underlying pulmonary arterial

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right thoracotomy and diaphragmatic plication.

 Comparison is made with prior study [**8-1**].

 Despite of the presence of two chest tubes in the right hemithorax, there is a
 large right basal pneumothorax.  There is large area of atelectasis in the
 right upper lobe and right middle lobe.  Increasing density in the right
 perihilar region is due to prior radiation.  Enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe
 could be due to atelectasis but aspiration cannot be excluded.  ET tube is in
 standard position.  Sternal wires are aligned.  Multiple surgical clips
 project in the right hilar region and right lower hemithorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  57-year-old male status post right sternothoracotomy, radical
 thymectomy, and en bloc right middle lobe wedge resection with sacrifice of
 the right phrenic nerves as well as right VATS decortication and diaphragmatic
 plication.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from [**2165-1-29**]
 and [**2165-11-6**].

 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest were obtained.  The patient is now
 intubated with the ET tube approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A hazy
 opacity is seen in the right upper lung, which is larger than previously seen
 and may represent aspiration versus pneumonia versus radiation pneumonitis.  A
 chest tube is located medial posterior sinus on the right.  An increased area
 of lucency at the right lung base is likely consistent with aeration of the
 lung or drainage of the previous pleural effusion.  There is no current
 pleural effusion.  The left lung does not show evidence of any acute
 infiltrate, although there is poor ventilation on the left.  Surgical clips
 are noted overlying the right lower lobe.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in the right upper lobe opacity, likely
 representing aspiration versus pneumonia versus radiation pneumonitis.
 Increased lucency of the right lower lung base, possibly representing aeration
 of the lung or drained pleural effusion.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from [**2165-8-5**].

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate interval removal of
 right-sided basilar chest tube.  There is no pneumothorax or other
 complication seen.  The right hilar and basilar opacities are again noted,
 unchanged from prior imaging.  A small left pleural effusion is again seen
 unchanged.  There is atelectasis visualized bilaterally at the bases.  Chest
 radiograph is otherwise unchanged from previous imaging.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right-sided chest tube.  Otherwise
 essentially unchanged chest radiograph from prior imaging.

 INDICATION:  57-year-old man status post thymectomy, postoperative day #4
 status post thoracotomy, now immediately status post chest tube removal.

 COMPARISON:  [**8-1**] to [**2165-8-4**].

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The superomedial
 right chest tube has been removed.  The right basilar chest tube remains.  A
 right basilar pneumothorax remains partially loculated.  Overall the right
 lung is better aerated compared to yesterday's exam.  Persistent opacity in
 the right hilus as well as interstitial opacities in the right upper lobe are
 similar.  There is a suggestion that linear opacities conform to a rounded
 contour in the right mid-lung.  A faint curvilinear line at the right lung
 apex corresponds to chain suture from prior lung resection.  There is no
 apical pneumothorax.  Left pleural effusion is small.  Otherwise, the left
 lung is clear.  Sternotomy wires are intact.


 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable appearance of loculated right basilar pneumothorax.  No new
 pneumothorax status post right medial chest tube removal.
 2.  Persistent right hilar and upper lobe lung opacities.  There is a
 suggestion that opacity surrounding a circular structure, however, this may be
 due to a combination of radiation fibrosis and atelectasis.  If there is
 concern for acute pulmonary process, chest CT would be better able to
 delineate anatomy.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4694**] via telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**8-5**], [**2164**].

 COMPARISON:  CXR [**2151-9-23**], CT [**2151-9-6**].

 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal allowing for lung volumes.
 Heart size is upper limits of normal.  The dual-chamber pacemaker leads end in
 the expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.

 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema or effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**3-20**], there is now an endotracheal tube
 in place with its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Central catheter
 again extends to level of the mid portion of the SVC.

 There has been the development of a dramatic bat [**Doctor First Name 2805**] appearance consistent
 with acute pulmonary edema following contrast reaction.  Some volume loss is
 seen at the left base with poor definition of the medial aspect of the
 hemidiaphragm.

 This information was discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12341**].

 COMPARISON:  [**2187-10-9**].

 SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:

 FINDINGS:  An OG tube is seen coursing into the proximal portion of the
 stomach.  Tracheostomy tube is in stable position.  Right subclavian catheter
 terminates in low SVC.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is similar to the
 prior exams and a retrocardiac opacity is stable and compatible with
 atelectasis although infection can have a similar appearance.  While the
 extremely low lung volumes particularly on the left are largely unchanged,
 there is a worsening left upper lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration
 versus atelectasis.

 CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST

 INDICATION:  49-year-old woman with persistent desaturations and tachycardia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2124-10-1**] CT Torso.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast and contrast-enhanced chest CTA protocol
 including thin sections and multiplanar reformatted images including bilateral
 oblique views were obtained and reviewed.

 FINDINGS:

 Non-contrast CT demonstrated mild heterogeneity of the visualized portions of
 the thyroid.  No significant supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.
 Diffuse hepatic steatosis is noted.

 The pulmonary trunk measures 3.1 cm in transverse dimension.  The ascending
 aorta and descending aorta are normal in caliber at this level.  No right
 heart strain is noted.  However, there are segmental and subsegmental right
 lower lobe and lingular pulmonary emboli noted, likely acute demonstrating
 ""polo mint and tram-track"" signs.  Bilateral small pleural effusions and
 basilar atelectasis are noted.  No other pulmonary emboli are noted.

 Mild intralobular septal thickening and linear subsegmental atelectasis are
 noted within the middle lobe, lingula and lung bases.

 Nonspecific small hypodense lesion measuring up to 1.2 cm in the left hepatic
 lobe (3:74).

 BONES:
 Redemonstration of burst fractures noted at the level of T3 and T6 through T8.
 The previously mentioned L1 and L2 right transverse process fractures are not
 included in the field-of-view on today's examination.  Redemonstration of mild
 degenerative changes in the lower thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparison is available.  The patient's true identity
 is not known at the time of reporting.

 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 large effusion or large pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for lung volumes.  No
 displaced rib fracture is seen.  There is no free air under the diaphragm.

 INDICATION:  49-year-old woman with fall and loss of consciousness for 10
 minutes with facial fractures and T3 fracture seen on outside study.

 COMPARISON:  CT [**2124-10-1**] from 12:30 a.m. from [**Hospital3 1307**] Hospital.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with 130 mL Omnipaque
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed with 5-mm
 slice thickness.

 CT CHEST:  A 1.3-cm left thyroid nodule is seen.  The thoracic aorta is normal
 in caliber without evidence of dissection.  The pulmonary artery is of normal
 caliber.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal hematoma.  No pathologically
 enlarged axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified, ranging up
 to 9 mm in the right lower paratracheal station.  There is no pericardial
 effusion.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits.

 Lung window images demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
 atelectasis or aspiration.  Patchy opacity in the right upper lobe (2:19)
 likely represents aspiration.

 CT ABDOMEN:  A 7-mm hypodensity in segment II of the liver (2:43) is too small
 to characterize.  There is fatty infiltration of the liver.  The gallbladder,
 spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys
 enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly without hydronephrosis.

 (Cont)

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  Submucosal colonic fat may be due to prior inflammation.  The
 appendix is visualized and is normal.  There is no mesenteric hematoma.  The
 abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout.  No pathologically enlarged
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.  A small amount of
 slightly hyperdense fluid (27 [**Doctor Last Name **]) adjacent to the IVC is seen (2:60).
 Diverticula are seen in the descending colon without inflammatory changes.

 CT PELVIS:  The rectum is normal.  Diverticula are seen in the sigmoid colon
 without inflammatory changes.  The bladder is normal.  Heterogeneous
 enhancement of the uterus may be due to fibroids with distortion of the
 endometrial cavity.  Rounded heterogenously hyperdense area in the region of
 the cervix measures 5.7 x 5.2 cm. Per report, the patient is currently
 menstruating.  A 4.2 x 2.3 cm right adnexal cyst is within the physiologic
 range if the patient is premenopausal.  No left adnexal mass is seen.  There
 is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Burst type fractures in the vertebral bodies of T3, T6, T7 and
 T8 as well as fractures of the right transverse processes of L1 and L2 are
 noted.  At T6, there is minimal retropulsion into the spinal canal.  No bone
 findings suspicious for infection or malignancy are seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis or aspiration.
 No pneumothorax.

 2.  Burst type vertebral body fractures in the thoracic spine and L1 and L2
 transverse processes fractures.  MRI could be performed for evaluation of cord
 injury.

 3.  Tiny amount of fluid adjacent to the IVC.  This could be related to IVC
 injury, although it is not as large as would be expected given the timeline of
 patient's accident and current study.  Low threshold to rescan the patient to
 evaluate for IVC injury if patient becomes unstable.

 4.  Colonic mural fat deposition suggests chronic inflammation.
 Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

 5.  A 1.3-cm left thyroid nodule.  Non-urgent ultrasound is recommended for
 further evaluation.

 6.  A 4 x 2 cm right adnexal cyst and heterogenous appearance of cervix.  The
 latter may be secondary to blood products from phase of patient's cycle, but
 follow-up pelvic ultrasound recommended to evaluate both findings.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, [**3-20**] to [**2130-8-4**].

 FINDINGS:

 Layering, moderate, bilateral pleural effusions are impossible to compare to
 the previous frontal studies.  There is no pneumothorax. Previous, severe
 pulmonary edema has almost resolved.  Bibasilar atelectasis is stable.  The
 mediastinal and cardiac diameters are top normal.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  Moderate, layering, bilateral pleural effusions cannot be compared to
 previous exam because of different technique.

 2.  Previoius, severe alveolar edema has almost completely resolved.

 COMPARISON:  [**2124-10-5**] radiograph.

 FINDINGS:  New right PICC terminates in the expected region of the junction of
 the superior vena cava and right atrium.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance allowing for positional differences between the studies.
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar haziness are present as well
 as bilateral partially layering pleural effusions, likely moderate in size on
 this semi-upright radiograph.  Adjacent areas of basilar lung opacity likely
 represent atelectasis, but infectious consolidation is also possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  As compared to the prior study, there has been
 slight improved aeration at the right lung base.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  53-year-old male patient with NG tube that had to be replaced, so
 he can get Gastroview.  Check position.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the lower chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  The image is under penetrated and it is impossible to
 identify the tip of the NG tube.  Observed through the lower cardiac shadow
 are the previously described dual intracavitary pacer electrodes, apparently
 in unchanged position.  Overlying EKG electrodes are external.  Similar as
 before, markedly distended large and small bowels are noted, indicating
 abnormal ileus.  P.S.  On a followup abdominal view obtained 45 minutes later,
 one can identify the NG tube in high infradiaphragmatic position, indicating
 that it is located in the stomach which, however, is markedly compressed by
 the distended bowel loops.  See separate report issued on abdominal
 examination.

 COMPARISON:  Series of radiographs, most recently from [**2188-1-9**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect view of the chest.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with prior radiograph, there is progression of the
 right sided pleural opacities, particurally in the lower lobes. The
 tracheostomy tube, pacemaker wires and right subclavian line in appropriate
 and stable positions.  Heart is again enlarged.  Left lung volume loss as well
 as opacities in left upper lobe continues largely unchanged.  Left upper lobe
 consolidation is consistent with aspiration versus atelectasis.

 PORTABLE CHEST:  The ETT and NGT remain unchanged in satisfactory position.
 There is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the distal right pulmonary
 artery.  There is mild cardiac enlargement.  The patient is status post CABG.
 Again seen are multifocal alveolar opacities of the pulmonary vascularity
 consistent with pulmonary edema, which has increased since the previous
 examination.  There are patchy areas of confluent opacities within the right
 upper lobe and the left lower lobe.  There is widening of the mediastinum
 which is stable in size, and is probably related to postoperative change.
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:  Increasing pulmonary edema with more focal areas of confluent
 opacity in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe which likely represent
 areas of asymmetric pulmonary edema vs. superimposed pneumonia or aspiration.

 HISTORY:  53-year-old male with altered mental status.

 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 [**2187-9-30**].  Compared with prior, there has been interval improvement
 in aeration at the right lung base with more clear delineation of the right
 hemidiaphragm. There is persistent increased opacity in the left hemithorax

 Cardiomediastinal silhouette has not changed.  Dual-lead pacing device is
 again noted as is a tracheostomy tube.  Subluxation of the glenohumeral joints
 is again noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval improved aeration at the right lung base.  Persistent
 increased opacity involving majority of the left hemithorax silhouetting the
 left hemidiaphragm with likely volume loss.  Overall, the findings have not
 significantly changed on the left since prior noting that infection cannot be
 excluded.  Please clinically correlate regarding the need for additional
 imaging.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.

 INDICATION:  49-year-old female patient with post-extubation hypertension.
 Evaluate for pneumothorax or acute process.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-
 recumbent position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar portable chest examination obtained seven hours earlier
 during the same day.  The previously present NG tube has been removed.  No
 pneumothorax can be identified.  Noted, however, are markedly increased
 densities predominantly overlying the lung bases, but reaching higher now on
 this portable chest examination.  One explanation could be that the previously
 present pleural effusions are layering higher up as the patient is in more
 supine position.  Evidence of bilateral basal atelectasis as before.  If
 quantification of pleural effusion is essential for future management, an
 additional lateral view could be of value.

 IMPRESSION:  The patient extubated and NG tube removed.  Increasing basal
 densities are worrisome for increased pleural effusion, but could be related
 to patient's different position and poor inspirational effort.  Telephone was
 placed to referring physician, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 14095**] at 2:10 p.m.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New right subclavian line placement.  Evaluate line
 placement.

 FINDINGS:

 Tracheostomy tube is again seen.  There has been interval placement of a
 right-sided subclavian central venous catheter, with the tip in the region of
 the cavoatrial junction.  There is a dual chamber cardiac pacemaker present,
 with leads as expected in position.

 Allowing for the lung volumes, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 probably within normal limits.  The left hemithorax appears unchanged since
 the prior examination, with disproportionate of volume loss of the left
 hemithorax compared with right, as well as retrocardiac opacity.  No osseous
 abnormalities are appreciated on this limited radiograph.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Right central venous catheter tip is in the region of the cavoatrial
 junction.

 2.  Persistent volume loss of the left hemithorax and retrocardiac opacity.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post redo repair aortic abdominal aneurysmal.

 The most recent study available for comparison is pre-op evaluation [**2195-8-5**] and [**8-11**].

 NG tube tip is coiled in the distal esophagus.  This finding was discussed by
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2184**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by phone at 7:25 p.m. on [**2195-10-15**].  ET tube
 ends 1 cm above the carina, can be withdrawn 2 cm for more standard position.
 Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the low lung volumes.
 Increased opacity in the right lung is a combination of pleural effusion and
 multifocal areas of atelectases, mainly in the right perihilar region and
 right upper lobe.  Left lower lobe atelectases are minimal.  The aorta is very
 tortuous.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.

 INDICATION:  53-year-old male with fever and shortness of breath.

 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of the same day
 at 0039 a.m.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright views of the chest were obtained.  Tracheostomy
 tube is in stable position.  Right subclavian central catheter terminates in
 the lower SVC.  Leads of a left chest wall pacer terminate over the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar to prior,
 allowing for difference in patient position.  Retrocardiac opacity is stable
 and compatible with atelectasis, although infection may have a similar
 appearance.  Left lung volume loss is similar to prior.  No pneumothorax is
 visualized, though the patient's chin obscures the left apex.

 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with stable left lung volume loss. Stable
 retrocardiac opacity is compatible with atelectasis but may represent
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.

 vein catheter, the tip of the catheter projects over the upper SVC.

 The patient has received a left pectoral pacemaker, the course and position of
 the leads is unremarkable.

 In the interval, the patient has developed a volume loss of the left lung,
 associated to a diffuse fibrotic process and pleural thickening.  In addition,
 a parenchymal opacity at the right upper lobe base is seen.  This opacity
 might be more recent and infectious in origin.

 The heart continues to be mildly enlarged.  Mild fluid overload is present.

 The parenchymal processes, if clinically relevant, could be further evaluated
 by CT.
