Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
multiple complaints - L chest pain, n/v, melena, leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
44 yo M with long psych history, depression, anxiety, h/o
narcotic abuse, cocaine, IVDA, panic attacks, DM type 2, hep C
(not treated, not followed here at liver service),
hypothyroidism, a fib who comes in with multiple complaints.
Almoost all of these complaints started on Monday, a time in
which he was also having to move residences because his
relationship was breaking up. All around this same time he had
nausea, intermittent episodes of squeezing chest pain worse with
inhalation (lasting about 20 minutes or so), crampy abdominal
pain, and nausea. He vomited 1-2 times and says that he vomited
some blood. He states that he had some loose, dark black stools;
his stools were guiaic positive but brown in ED. + chills, night
sweats, no fevers. Non-productive cough. In the ED he gave a
history of L sided pleuritic CP radiating to neck X 3 days.
Unable to eat due to poor appetite and nausea. Has not taken any
insulin with FS in 300s. L leg numbness and tingling since
Monday without back pain. +knee buckling; a neighbor saw him
fall, and called EMS. Last EtOH 1 month ago, denies any drug
abuse. But tox screen positive - pt admits to xanax, percocet,
tramadol.
.
In the ED BP 115/58, HR 92, RR 20, O2 sat 100% on RA. He was
tachycardic to 106, with some afib noted in the ED but not on
EKG; BPs nl, O2 sat 100%. Guaiac pos soft brown stool, good
rectal tone. Would not tolerate NGL. Some decreased sensation to
L4 dermatome. Got 3 L IVFs. EKG without ischemic changes, trops
negative.  Labs were also significant for Hct 37.5, BUN 72, Cr
1.3, CK 4011, D-dimer 2670, urine tox positive for benzos and
opiates. An EKG was negative for any ischemic changes. Pt
refused NGL, seen by GI who recommended PPI, serial Hcts, and
EGD in am.
.
Given elevated d-dimer and pt's reported contrast dye allergy,
V/Q scan performed that was mod probability for PE (subsegmental
V/Q mismatch in superior aspect of b/l upper lobes and posterior
basal segment of LLL). Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT. He
was given 3L IVFs, protonix 40 mg IV X 1, morphine 6 mg IV,
zofran 4 mg IV X 2, and 4 units regular insulin for FS 241.
Given the ED's concern for not having a clear explanation for
the pt's multiple complaints, and given that some of these
complaints might point to acute problems, he was admitted to the
ICU for closer monitoring.

Port CXR [**12-13**] - Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion.  Osseous structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

V/Q Scan [**12-13**] - Subsegmental perfusion/ventilation mismatch
involving the superior segments of both upper lobes and the
posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe.  Findings
represent a moderate probability for pulmonary embolus of
undetermined chronicity.  If clinically indicated, further
evaluation with lower extremity ultrasound to assess for DVT and
a repeat VQ scan in 24-48 hours could be performed.

INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate no
abnormalities.

Perfusion images in the same 8 views show no areas of decreased
perfusion.

Chest x-ray shows no areas of consolidation.

The above findings are consistent with a normal study.

IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of previously seen
perfusion/ventilation
subsegmental defects. Normal study.


Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo M with hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, PAF, depression,
anxiety, and h/o past narcotic, benzo, and IVDA who presents to
the ED with multiple complaints including L pleuritic chest
pain, nausea, possible hematemesis and melena, found to have
intermediate probability study for PE on V/Q scan, admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close observation overnight.
.
# L chest pain - Described as pleuritic in nature with elevated
d-dimer to 2670 in ED. V/Q scan with subsegmental V/Q mismatch
in superior segments of both upper lobes and in posterior basal
segment of LLL. Bilateral LENIs negative for evidence of DVT.
Otherwise, clinical suspicion for acute PE is relatively low
given lack of hypoxia, no EKG changes (S1Q3T3). Pt is
tachycardic, but there are other possible explanations for this
including melena, poor po intake, pain, and possible benzo
withdrawal. No evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG, troponins
flat. CXR without evidence of enlarged mediastinum.  Repeat V/Q
low probability/normal study and chest pain resolved
spontaneously.

# Melena: EGD with esophagitis, GI recommended 4 week repeat
EGD, [**Hospital1 **] ppi x 1 mo, avoid NSAIDS.  Appointment arranged for
follow up on discharge.

# Leg weakness: Has history of sciatic pain in left leg. Also
has past back injury with L4-L5 disk bulging. Sensory/strength
exam possibly concerning for L4-5 deficit. PT, supportive care.
.
# Acute renal failure: prerenal, resolved with fluids.
.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: resumed home dose of metformin with
good control.

# Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes along with elevated CK,
ALT is at a peak relative. Combination of transaminitis with
elevated CK could be concerning for toxic or medication effect,
might be statin effect. Discontinued statin and LFTs trended
down, near normal at discharge.  Should be repeated in 4 weeks
to assure normalization.

# Hypothyroidism: normal TSH.

# PAF: Currently in NSR. Not on coumadin as outpt. On metoprolol
12.5 mg po bid.

# Homelessness/Substance abuse: psychiatry evaluated patient and
initially recommended inpatient psychiatry after medical
clearance, but subsequently felt he did not require
hospitalization.  He was arranged to go to a safe house by
social work, but refused.  He was discharged to the street with
options for homeless shelters.

# Psych: reinitiated home psych meds.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   44 year old man with extensive psychiatric hx developed multiple
   complaints four days ago. Had nausea, intermittent squeezing chest pain
   worse with inhalation, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting once or twice
   with questionable hemetemesis and dark stools (in ED stool was brown
   and guaiac positive). Unable to eat due to nausea; did not take insulin
   and blood sugar up to 300 at home. Came to ED because of ""buckling of
   knee"" with fall. Last ETOH one  month ago. Has been using Xanax and
   percocet at home.
   In ED, O2 sat 100% on RA. Patient didn't tolerate NG tube. Received 3L
   of fluid for CPK 5000. Creat was 1.3. D-dimer 2670.  V/Q scan done -
   ""intermediate probability"" with subsegmental defects. LENI negative
   bilaterally. Patient unable to have CTA because of hx of contrast
   reaction.
   In ED, hemodynamically stable. O2 sats excellent on room air. Sensory
   deficit noted on exam on lateral left leg and foot; associated motor
   defect. Sent for MRI this AM. No furhter vomiting. No evidence of
   ongoing bleeding.

   studies. Would aim for positive fluid balance today of approximately
   2L.
   V/Q scan minimally abnormal in region (apices) that would be unusual
   for PE. Patient states non-smoker, but there is other hx to suggest
   that he has smoked in the past. General story is not suggestive of PE;
   LENI's negative. Would consider ABG on room air; if normal A-aDO2,
   makes PE unlikely (only 10% of patients with PE have normal A-aDO2).

   Monday, a time in which he was also having to move residences because
   his relationship was breaking up. All around this same time he had
   nausea, intermittent episodes of squeezing chest pain worse with
   inhalation (lasting about 20 minutes or so), crampy abdominal pain, and
   nausea. He vomited 1-2 times and says that he vomited some blood. He
   states that he had some loose, dark black stools; his stools were
   guiaic positive but brown in ED. + chills, night sweats, no fevers.
   Non-productive cough. In the ED he gave a history of L sided pleuritic
   CP radiating to neck X 3 days. Unable to eat due to poor appetite and
   nausea. Has not taken any insulin with FS in 300s. L leg numbness and
   tingling since Monday without back pain. +knee buckling; a neighbor saw
   him fall, and called EMS. Last EtOH 1 month ago, denies any drug abuse.
   But tox screen positive - pt admits to xanax, percocet, tramadol.
   .
   In the ED BP 115/58, HR 92, RR 20, O2 sat 100% on RA. He was
   tachycardic to 106, with some afib noted in the ED but not on EKG; BPs
   nl, O2 sat 100%. Guaiac pos soft brown stool, good rectal tone. Would
   not tolerate NGL. Some decreased sensation to L4 dermatome. Got 3 L
   IVFs. EKG without ischemic changes, trops negative. Labs were also
   significant for Hct 37.5, BUN 72, Cr 1.3, CK 4011, D-dimer 2670, urine
   tox positive for benzos and opiates. An EKG was negative for any
   ischemic changes. Pt refused NGL, seen by GI who recommended PPI,
   serial Hcts, and EGD in am.
   .
   Given elevated d-dimer and pt's reported contrast dye allergy, V/Q scan
   performed that was mod probability for PE (subsegmental V/Q mismatch in
   superior aspect of b/l upper lobes and posterior basal segment of LLL).
   Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT. He was given 3L IVFs, protonix
   40 mg IV X 1, morphine 6 mg IV, zofran 4 mg IV X 2, and 4 units regular
   insulin for FS 241. Given the ED's concern for not having a clear
   explanation for the pt's multiple complaints, and given that some of
   these complaints might point to acute problems, he was admitted to the
   ICU for closer monitoring.

   There is no pleural effusion. Osseous structures are unremarkable.

   .
   V/Q Scan [**12-13**] - Subsegmental perfusion/ventilation mismatch involving
   the superior segments of both upper lobes and the posterior basal

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo M with hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, PAF, depression, anxiety, and
   h/o past narcotic, benzo, and IVDA who presents to the ED with multiple
   complaints including L pleuritic chest pain, nausea, possible
   hematemesis and melena, found to have intermediate probability study
   for PE on V/Q scan, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for close observation overnight.
   .
   # L chest pain - Described as pleuritic in nature with elevated d-dimer
   to 2670 in ED. V/Q scan with subsegmental V/Q mismatch in superior
   segments of both upper lobes and in posterior basal segment of LLL.
   Bilateral LENIs negative for evidence of DVT. Otherwise, clinical
   suspicion for acute PE is relatively low given lack of hypoxia, no EKG
   changes (S1Q3T3). Pt is tachycardic, but there are other possible
   explanations for this including melena, poor po intake, pain, and
   possible benzo withdrawal. No evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG,
   troponins flat. CXR without evidence of enlarged mediastinum.
   - Hold on anticoagulating for now given possible concern for GI bleed
   (see below).
   - Repeat V/Q scan in 24-48 hours per radiology recs; if revealing for
   similar findings, is more likely that pt actually does have PE and will
   need to reconsider starting anti-coagulation.
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes to obtain full set.
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - EKG in am.
   .
   # Melena: Currently hemodynamically stable with OB+ brown stool.
   Patient refuses NGT to screen for more active bleeding. There is also
   question of possible episode of hematemesis. Hct currently at pt's
   baseline (mid 30s to low 40s). Potential sources includes gastritis,
   PUD, AVM, less likely variceal bleed.
   - EGD in am, NPO p midnight.
   - cycle Hct q8h.
   - PPI po bid.
   - F/u any additional GI recs.
   - PIV X 2
   - typed and crossed 2 units.
   .
   # Leg weakness: Has history of sciatic pain in left leg. Also has past
   back injury with L4-L5 disk bulging. Sensory/strength exam possibly
   concerning for L4-5 deficit. Might also consider cryoglobulin-driven
   neuropathy given Hep C.
   - Hold off on NSAIDs for now given concern for possible GI bleed.
   - Check lumbar MRI.
   - Check cryoglobulins, TSH.
   - Consider neuro consult in AM.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely pre-renal in the setting of dehydration
   and GI bleed. Pt with elevated BUN: Cr ratio. Baseline Cr 0.7 - 1.0.
   CKs are elevated; however, UA only with small bld, 0-2 RBC thus making
   clinically significant rhabdomyolysis very unlikely.
   - IVFs overnight @ 150 cc/hr.
   - Trend CKs, are already coming down after IVF hydration in ED.
   - Closely trend renal function.
   - Consider urine lytes in am if renal function not improving after IVF
   hydration.
   .
   # Elevated CK: As above, unlikely to be rhabdomyolysis based off of UA,
   relatively small elevation in Cr. Unclear etiology for elevation of
   CKs; could be myositis from statin though his history is not consistent
   with this, does not give story of general muscle aches; does not give
   good history for seizure, does not affirm LOC or sustained time on the
   ground; does not test positive for cocaine on tox screen; no other
   clear focus of tissue damage. If result of muscle damage in L leg, not
   clinically evident location, and not a clear syndrome/diagnosis to
   account for this.
   - Trend CKs, Cr.
   - IVFs @ 200 cc/hr.
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus type 2: Currently with poor control as evidenced by
   large glucosuria and serum glucose. Minimal AG expansion so unlikely to
   have clinically significant DKA, only trace ketones on UA.
   - Check HbA1c.
   - Hydrate with IVFs as above.
   - Continue home dose of insulin, add HISS.
   - Hold metformin until renal function resolves.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes along with elevated CK, ALT is
   at a peak relative. Combination of transaminitis with elevated CK could
   be concerning for toxic or medication effect, might be statin effect.
   Pt also admits to unknown amount of percocet use.
   - holding statin.
   - Check acetaminophen level.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Checking TSH given possibility that pt has recently
   not been adherent to medication and neuropathy on exam.
   .
   # PAF: Currently in NSR. Not on coumadin as outpt. Holding metoprolol
   given concern for GI bleed.
   .
   # Homelessness/Substance abuse: Patient initially denied substance
   abuse history in ED, and upon positive return of urine tox for benzos
   and opiates did admit to recently taking xanax and percocet. Per prior
   psych admission notes, patient has history of addictions to percocet,
   oxycontin, heroin, and methadone. Pt gives us inconsistent history on
   arrival.
   - SW and addictions consult.
   - Monitor closely for any signs of benzo or opiate withdrawal.
   .
   # Psych: With h/o depression, anxiety, multiple prior suicide attempts,
   PTSD, panic attacks, and agoraphobia. Also with multiple psychiatric
   admissions in past. Currently quite flat in affect, possibly to the
   point of neurovegetative symptoms, denying any SI/HI; reporting recent
   life stressors of relationship breakup and moving out of his former
   residence.
   - Psych consult in am for revisiting psych treatment for depression,
   not in psychiatry tx now

   pain
   HPI:
   44 yo M with long psych history, depression, anxiety, h/o narcotic
   abuse, cocaine, IVDA, panic attacks, DM type 2, hep C (not treated, not
   followed here at liver service), hypothyroidism, a fib who comes in
   with multiple complaints. Almost all of these complaints started on
   Monday, a time in which he was also having to move residences because
   his relationship was breaking up. All around this same time he had
   nausea, intermittent episodes of squeezing chest pain worse with
   inhalation (lasting about 20 minutes or so), crampy abdominal pain, and
   nausea. He vomited 1-2 times and says that he vomited some blood. He
   states that he had some loose, dark black stools; his stools were
   guiaic positive but brown in ED. + chills, night sweats, no fevers.
   Non-productive cough. In the ED he gave a history of L sided pleuritic
   CP radiating to neck X 3 days. Unable to eat due to poor appetite and
   nausea. Has not taken any insulin with FS in 300s. L leg numbness and
   tingling since Monday without back pain. +knee buckling; a neighbor saw
   him fall, and called EMS. Last EtOH 1 month ago, denies any drug abuse.
   But tox screen positive - pt admits to xanax, percocet, tramadol.
   .
   In the ED BP 115/58, HR 92, RR 20, O2 sat 100% on RA. He was
   tachycardic to 106, with some afib noted in the ED but not on EKG; BPs
   nl, O2 sat 100%. Guaiac pos soft brown stool, good rectal tone. Would
   not tolerate NGL. Some decreased sensation to L4 dermatome. Got 3 L
   IVFs. EKG without ischemic changes, trops negative. Labs were also
   significant for Hct 37.5, BUN 72, Cr 1.3, CK 4011, D-dimer 2670, urine
   tox positive for benzos and opiates. An EKG was negative for any
   ischemic changes. Pt refused NGL, seen by GI who recommended PPI,
   serial Hcts, and EGD in am.
   .
   Given elevated d-dimer and pt's reported contrast dye allergy, V/Q scan
   performed that was mod probability for PE (subsegmental V/Q mismatch in
   superior aspect of b/l upper lobes and posterior basal segment of LLL).
   Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT. He was given 3L IVFs, protonix
   40 mg IV X 1, morphine 6 mg IV, zofran 4 mg IV X 2, and 4 units regular
   insulin for FS 241. Given the ED's concern for not having a clear
   explanation for the pt's multiple complaints, and given that some of
   these complaints might point to acute problems, he was admitted to the
   ICU for closer monitoring.

   Imaging: Port CXR [**12-13**] - Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
   normal. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
   There is no pleural effusion. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
   .
   V/Q Scan [**12-13**] - Subsegmental perfusion/ventilation mismatch involving
   the superior segments of both upper lobes and the posterior basal
   segment of the left lower lobe. Findings represent a moderate
   probability for pulmonary embolus of undetermined chronicity. If
   clinically indicated, further evaluation with lower extremity
   ultrasound to assess for DVT and a repeat VQ scan in 24-48 hours could
   be performed.
   B/L LENIs [**12-13**] (prelim read) - negative for DVT
   ECG:  NSR @ 95 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST dep or elev, no qs, no
   TWIs, no S1Q3T3, unchanged from prior on [**1-25**]
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo M with hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, PAF, depression, anxiety, and
   h/o past narcotic, benzo, and IVDA who presents to the ED with multiple
   complaints including L pleuritic chest pain, nausea, possible
   hematemesis and melena, found to have intermediate probability study
   for PE on V/Q scan, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for close observation overnight.
   .
   # L chest pain - Described as pleuritic in nature with elevated d-dimer
   to 2670 in ED. V/Q scan with subsegmental V/Q mismatch in superior
   segments of both upper lobes and in posterior basal segment of LLL.
   Bilateral LENIs negative for evidence of DVT. Otherwise, clinical
   suspicion for acute PE is relatively low given lack of hypoxia, no EKG
   changes (S1Q3T3). Pt is tachycardic, but there are other possible
   explanations for this including melena, poor po intake, pain, and
   possible benzo withdrawal. No evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG,
   troponins flat. CXR without evidence of enlarged mediastinum.
   - Hold on anticoagulating for now given possible concern for GI bleed
   (see below).
   - Repeat V/Q scan in 24-48 hours per radiology recs; if revealing for
   similar findings, is more likely that pt actually does have PE and will
   need to reconsider starting anti-coagulation.
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes to obtain full set.
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - EKG in am.
   .
   # Melena: Currently hemodynamically stable with OB+ brown stool.
   Patient refuses NGT to screen for more active bleeding. There is also
   question of possible episode of hematemesis. Hct currently at pt's
   baseline (mid 30s to low 40s). Potential sources includes gastritis,
   PUD, AVM, less likely variceal bleed.
   - EGD in am, NPO p midnight.
   - cycle Hct q8h.
   - PPI po bid.
   - F/u any additional GI recs.
   - PIV X 2
   - typed and crossed 2 units.
   .
   # Leg weakness: Has history of sciatic pain in left leg. Also has past
   back injury with L4-L5 disk bulging. Sensory/strength exam possibly
   concerning for L4-5 deficit. Might also consider cryoglobulin-driven
   neuropathy given Hep C.
   - Hold off on NSAIDs for now given concern for possible GI bleed.
   - Check lumbar MRI.
   - Check cryoglobulins, TSH.
   - Consider neuro consult in AM.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely pre-renal in the setting of dehydration
   and GI bleed. Pt with elevated BUN: Cr ratio. Baseline Cr 0.7 - 1.0.
   CKs are elevated; however, UA only with small bld, 0-2 RBC thus making
   clinically significant rhabdomyolysis very unlikely.
   - IVFs overnight @ 150 cc/hr.
   - Trend CKs, are already coming down after IVF hydration in ED.
   - Closely trend renal function.
   - Consider urine lytes in am if renal function not improving after IVF
   hydration.
   .
   # Elevated CK: As above, unlikely to be rhabdomyolysis based off of UA,
   relatively small elevation in Cr. Unclear etiology for elevation of
   CKs; could be myositis from statin though his history is not consistent
   with this, does not give story of general muscle aches; does not give
   good history for seizure, does not affirm LOC or sustained time on the
   ground; does not test positive for cocaine on tox screen; no other
   clear focus of tissue damage. If result of muscle damage in L leg, not
   clinically evident location, and not a clear syndrome/diagnosis to
   account for this.
   - Trend CKs, Cr.
   - IVFs @ 200 cc/hr.
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus type 2: Currently with poor control as evidenced by
   large glucosuria and serum glucose. Minimal AG expansion so unlikely to
   have clinically significant DKA, only trace ketones on UA.
   - Check HbA1c.
   - Hydrate with IVFs as above.
   - Continue home dose of insulin, add HISS.
   - Hold metformin until renal function resolves.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes along with elevated CK, ALT is
   at a peak relative. Combination of transaminitis with elevated CK could
   be concerning for toxic or medication effect, might be statin effect.
   Pt also admits to unknown amount of percocet use.
   - holding statin.
   - Check acetaminophen level.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Checking TSH given possibility that pt has recently
   not been adherent to medication and neuropathy on exam.
   .
   # PAF: Currently in NSR. Not on coumadin as outpt. Holding metoprolol
   given concern for GI bleed.
   .
   # Homelessness/Substance abuse: Patient initially denied substance
   abuse history in ED, and upon positive return of urine tox for benzos
   and opiates did admit to recently taking xanax and percocet. Per prior
   psych admission notes, patient has history of addictions to percocet,
   oxycontin, heroin, and methadone. Pt gives us inconsistent history on
   arrival.
   - SW and addictions consult.
   - Monitor closely for any signs of benzo or opiate withdrawal.
   .
   # Psych: With h/o depression, anxiety, multiple prior suicide attempts,
   PTSD, panic attacks, and agoraphobia. Also with multiple psychiatric
   admissions in past. Currently quite flat in affect, possibly to the
   point of neurovegetative symptoms, denying any SI/HI; reporting recent
   life stressors of relationship breakup and moving out of his former
   residence.
   - Psych consult in am for revisiting psych treatment for depression,
   not in psychiatry tx now
